## Sign-up
<!---
### Which email address I should use to sign up?

If your company has an existing relationship with Microsoft and you're allowed to do self-service trials, use your company email address. We'll establish your trial on your company’s account.

If your company doesn't have an existing relationship with Microsoft or you aren’t allowed to do self-service trials on your company’s existing account, use your personal email to sign up and we'll create a temporary account for you. You'll be the administrator of the account and for the trial.-->

### What are the system requirements for the trial?

This app is a cloud-based service that doesn't require special software other than an up-to-date web browser, though some restrictions apply. For the best trial experience, avoid accessing the trial site in incognito mode. [Learn more about web application requirements](/power-platform/admin/web-application-requirements).

### How do I sign up for the trial without a Microsoft 365 tenant?

You can enter a non-work email address and we will create an account and tenant for you.

### Can I sign up for multiple Dynamics 365 apps such as Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service?

Yes, you can. To view all available trials, [visit the trial hub page](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics-365/free-trial). You can use the same email account to sign up for different trials. However, it is not possible to have multiple apps on the same trial site. Each trial will be on a different org and URL. The trial data won’t be shared across apps.

## Trial app

### I didn't receive the trial details email after signing up, what should I do?

When you sign up for the trial, you'll receive an email with the trial details. If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder. Alternatively, use the following steps to access your app:

1. Go to trial site and select **Try for free**.
1. Enter the email ID that you used to sign up for the trial. You'll be redirected to your trial app.

### How do I add more users to a trial?

To add users, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) using the trial admin account. Follow the [admin center guidance](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to add users up to the trial license limit. If the user you are adding already has a Microsoft 365 account, assign them an appropriate security role in the trial org. For more information, see [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).

### How many users can I add to my trial environment?

You can add an unlimited number of users to the trial environment.

### How do I reset the trial environment?

You can't reset the trial environment. However, you can wait for the trial period to end and then sign up again for a new trial.

## Trial expiration and extension

### Why did my trial expire before the end of the trial period?

The trial expires if there's no activity for 14 consecutive days. An email notification is sent to you after seven days of inactivity. Expired trials cannot be reactivated. However, you can start a new trial.

### How do I extend the trial?

You can extend the trial for another trial period in the admin center. For instructions, see [Extend your trial](/power-platform/admin/trial-environments#extend-a-trial-standard-environment). You can extend your trial once.
