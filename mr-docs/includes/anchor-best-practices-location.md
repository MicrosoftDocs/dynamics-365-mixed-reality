- **Location.** Place the anchor in a location on the physical object that's easy to access and out of the way so it doesn't interfere with work.

  - Ideally, anchor placement should be central to the steps being done.

  - Content placed farther away from the anchor is less accurate.

  - Place the anchor where operators can quickly rescan to realign at any time.

  - Ideally, the anchor shouldn't be moved after the author places it. If a permanent placement isn't possible, consider creating a mount so that the anchor can be consistently placed in the same location/orientation every time.

  - [Take a photo or video](/hololens/holographic-photos-and-videos) to document the anchor placement, and add it to the guide instructions to help increase operator confidence.
