You can collaborate using spatial annotations with an external user who isn't a part of your organization. For example, having a call with a vendor or a contractor to solve a problem or discuss a process using augmented reality. If your collaborators don't have a Dynamics 365 Field Service, Guides, or Remote Assist license, they can still use spatial annotations when they join a call or meeting on a one-time basis. The system only requires one licensed user to unlock spatial annotation capabilities to all other mobile and desktop users.

Make sure your Teams admin has [enabled meetings for external users](/microsoftteams/plan-meetings#meeting-options-for-guests-and-external-participants).

1. Create a Teams meeting or start a call with one participant having a Dynamics 365 Field Service, Guides, or Remote Assist license and invite your other participants.

1. All participants can [use spatial annotations](../remote-assist/teams-mobile-annotate.md#use-annotations)  as long as one person on the call has a Field Service, Guides, or Remote Assist license.
