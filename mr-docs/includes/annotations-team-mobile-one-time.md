You might want an external user without a Microsoft Teams license to join a call on a one-time basis. It only takes one Microsoft Teams license from a mobile user to unlock spatial annotation capabilities to all other mobile and desktop users in a Teams call.

Make sure your Teams admin has [enabled meetings for external users](/microsoftteams/plan-meetings#meeting-options-for-guests-and-external-participants).

1. Create a Teams meeting with the organizer (one who has a Teams mobile license) and invite your participants to the meeting.

1. Ensure the organizer joins the call first, then have the invited members join.

1. Members can [use spatial annotations](../remote-assist/teams-mobile-annotate.md#use-annotations) as long as the organizer is on the call.
