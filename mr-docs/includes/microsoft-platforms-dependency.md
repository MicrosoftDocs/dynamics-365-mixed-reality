Dynamics 365 Guides is dependent on three Microsoft platforms:

- Microsoft Dataverse
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Core Service
- Microsoft Teams

In rare cases, changes to these underlying platforms can cause issues in Dynamics 365 Guides. Likewise, a change to one of these platforms can resolve a Dynamics 365 Guides issue. To learn about the schedule for changes to these platforms, see the following articles:
