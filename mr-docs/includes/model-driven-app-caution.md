> [!CAUTION]
> The Guides model-driven app is intended for specific purposes that are covered in the Dynamics 365 Guides documentation. It isn't intended as a replacement for authoring in the PC and HoloLens apps. If you use the model-driven app to create, update, or delete records, you might make Dynamics 365 Guides nonfunctional or prevent users from using the PC or HoloLens apps in the intended way. Currently, guide modification through the model-driven app isn't fully supported and should be reserved for experienced Dynamics 365 users who are familiar with Microsoft Dataverse.
