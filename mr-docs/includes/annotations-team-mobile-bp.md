The person with the mobile device who shares their space for annotating should establish tracking. Tracking enables the mobile device to build a spatial map of visual feature points in the space. Without proper tracking, the mobile device doesn't understand the space and spatial annotations might not attach or be placed as expected.

For best results, the person should do a quick scan of the area they want to annotate:

- Point the camera where you want to annotate, covering different angles and distances.
- Move the camera around slowly to gather data about the space, object, or point of interest.
- Point the camera at different angles and distances from the object.
- Ensure even lighting conditions to detect surfaces and objects clearly.
- Use textured surfaces to provide more visual feature points to track, rather than uniform, shiny, or translucent surfaces.

If something interrupts the camera, tracking might temporarily be lost and annotations are unavailable. The system can recover when the camera detects familiar feature points again. The message "Please wait while Mixed Reality user re-establishes tracking" appears. Wait a moment for the camera to re-establishe tracking so annotations are available.
