Spatial annotations can greatly enhance your communication and collaboration, especially when working with remote teams. Use spatial annotations to:

- **Quickly communicate detailed and complex instructions visually**: Enhance communication by using Remote Assist to engage remote collaborators through annotations.
- **Bring critical information into view**: Remote collaborators can offer precise guidance for different parts, including hard-to-reach parts. Use drawings and arrows to refer to specific parts of a machine or asset.
- **Solve problems in real time**: Technicians can share their real-time view with experts in remote locations to get the help they need, reducing travel time and cost.
- **Knowledge sharing and training**: Use annotations, photos, and videos to share with the rest of your organization.
