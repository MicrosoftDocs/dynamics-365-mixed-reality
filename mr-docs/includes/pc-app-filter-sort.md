> [!TIP]
> To find items quickly, you can filter by asset type (3D parts, images, videos, and object anchors) or sort by name, date, or type in ascending or descending order. If you are in a folder that does not contain the asset, a message displays. Navigate the hierarchy of folders or go to the parent folder and try your filter or sort again.
