# Making and taking calls in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens 

You can make a one-to-one or group call in Remote Assist on HoloLens. You can also join a meeting scheduled using Microsoft Teams or Outlook.

A **one-to-one call** includes two participants. For example, if you’re repairing a machine and need help on-the-go, you can make a one-to-one call to a remote collaborator who uses Teams.

A **group call** includes three or more participants. For example, if you’re inspecting an asset in a one-to-one call but need a third person’s expertise, any participant can add the third person to the call to form a group call.  

A **meeting** is a call scheduled using Teams or Outlook. It can include any number of participants. For example, if you want to have a weekly inspection with your team, you can create a meeting so that everyone receives notifications about the meeting and can join the meeting.

## Make a one-to-one call to a contact in your company

When you open Remote Assist, you'll see your recent contacts list in the Call tab. To call one of the contacts you see, select the contact. 


If you're using a Dynamics 365 Field Service work order, you can call the contact assigned to your work order. Select the Dynamics 365 icon (or say, "Remote Assist, Dynamics"), go to your instance and booking, then select the **Support Contact** listed.

If you don’t see the contact you want, select Search and then use the holographic keyboard to enter a name or email address.

## Make a one-to-one call to a Teams user outside your organization

> [!Note]
> You can make or receive a one-to-one call with a Teams user from another company if your administrator has set up [federation or guesting](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/out-of-tenant-overview#solution-1-federation).  

To call a federated user, open the app, select **Search**, and then use the holographic keyboard to enter their full email address. You won't see any search results if you enter just a name or a partial email address. After you call them once, they will appear in your recent contacts list, so you will not have to search for them again. 

> [!Note]
> If you're not able to find the contact you're looking for, it might be because federation has not been enabled in Microsoft Teams for your company or the other company. Contact your administrator for help.

## Make a group call 

A group call can include a single Remote Assist HoloLens or HoloLens 2 user and up to 49 Teams Desktop users, although adding more participants may impact call quality. You can also switch between participants' video feeds and mute participants as needed. 

Start by calling one person, and then select **Open Participants** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the open participants icon.](media/RAHL_Participants.png)).

You'll see the first person you called on the left side of the video card, and a list of participants on the right side of the video card. On the bottom of the video card is a text field. Select it, and a holographic keyboard will pop out. A list of your recent contacts will appear. If the person you'd like to call isn't on the list, enter a name or email address using the holographic keyboard, and then select a name in the search results to start the call.

To mute a participant, select **Open Participants** or say "Remote Assist, Open Participants." Tap on a participant to see a video feed of them. Tap on a participant’s mute button next to their name to mute them. A muted participant is the only one who can unmute themselves. 

> [!Note]
> You can't mute another participant in a one-to-one call. You can only mute and unmute yourself.

## Accept a call 

Select **Video** (or say "Remote Assist, Video") to accept the call as a video call or **Audio** (or say "Remote Assist, Audio") to accept it as a voice-only call. To decline the call, select **Ignore** (or say "Remote Assist, Ignore"). 

> [!Note]
> To receive calls when you’re using other apps on HoloLens, first open the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app. Then use the **Start** gesture to go to the start menu, and select another app to use. This keeps Remote Assist running in the background.
> 
> You’ll get a notification if a Remote Assist call comes in, and you’ll be able to select **Accept** to initiate an audio call, **Video** to initiate a video call, and **Ignore** to ignore the call. 
>
> In other words, you can receive a call in two scenarios – if Remote Assist is the app you have open and if it’s running in the background. 

When you join the call, remote collaborators will be able to see what you see in your space—including holograms.

## End a call

To end a call, select **End Call** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the end call icon.](media/RAHL_EndCall.png)), or say "Remote Assist, End Call."
