# Collaborate with any user through Microsoft Teams mobile

> [!TIP]
> Dynamics 365 Remote Assist customers now have access to Remote Assist in Microsoft Teams mobile. For the best calling experience on HoloLens, use Dynamics 365 Guides.

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist users and Microsoft Teams users can collaborate using various devices to solve problems together, faster. Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is available on HoloLens 2, and AR-capable iOS and Android mobile phones and tablets. Remote collaborators can use Teams on PC or mobile to collaborate with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist users. The benefit of using Teams on mobile (versus PC) is that you can collaborate with any user on-the-go.

When you use Teams on mobile, you can collaborate using the Spatial Annotations toolbar in a call with anyone who is using HoloLens 2 or another Teams user on PC, Mac, or mobile.

## Make a call

Launch Teams and go to the **Calls** tab.

  ![Screenshot showing the calls icon in Teams.](media/TeamsMobile_Call.png)

Under **History**, you see your recent contacts. Select one of the contacts to call them.

## Use call controls

![Screenshot showing the call controls in Teams mobile.](media/TeamsMobile_CallControl.png "Call control")

Use call controls to specify whether your collaborator can see what you see, hear what you hear, and more.

Call controls are found at the bottom of the screen.
- The **Video icon** controls outgoing video.
- The **Microphone icon** controls outgoing audio.
- The **Speaker icon** controls incoming audio.

For more actions, select the ellipses icon. Other actions include:
-	**Toggle incoming video**
-	**Share your screen** – your screen pops up as a video in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user’s world.
-	**Start video with blur** (iOS only) - useful if you have sensitive information behind you or want to protect the privacy of colleagues who are behind you.
- **Insert file** to share a file.

## Send a text message

Select the **Text icon** (which looks like this: ![Graphic showing the text icon, which looks like a chat bubble.](media/TeamsMobile_Text.png)) to open the text chat and send text messages. After the call, all participants can access the messages (and OneDrive and Teams file links) via the Teams chat. 

> [!NOTE]
> You may notice that you can attach a photo, gif, or file via the text message. This is not the best way to share a file. Please read the next two sections to learn how to share a OneDrive file and a photo from your device.

## Share OneDrive file

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamics 365 Remote Assist follows Teams policies for sharing files. If your Teams policies are configured to prevent file sharing, users won't be able to share files with each other. See these links for more info:
> - [Use guest access and external access to collaborate with people outside your organization](/microsoftteams/communicate-with-users-from-other-organizations#compare-external-and-guest-access)
> - [Native chat experience for external (federated) users in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/native-chat-for-external-users)

You can display OneDrive files in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user's space or send OneDrive files in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile text chat. For example, add a PDF of a diagram to assist with the call.

Go to the call controls and select the ellipses icon [...]. Then select **Insert Files** and select whether to insert file from OneDrive or from Teams teams and channels. You can insert an image, still gif, video, or PDF.

If you're collaborating with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user, the file is uploaded to OneDrive and appear up as a new slate in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user’s environment. The Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user can save a file to their OneDrive by tapping the OneDrive icon in the top right of the slate. The OneDrive file is then automatically saved to a folder called "HoloLens Received Files." A link to the file is available in the Teams chat even after the call ends.

If you're collaborating with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user, the file is uploaded to OneDrive and sent in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user’s text chat. A link to the file is available in the Teams chat even after the call ends.

## Share photo from device

Go to call controls and select the ellipses icon […]. Then select **Insert Files** and select **Photo**. Then, take a photo or select a photo from your mobile device’s photo gallery.

Select the text chat. The photo is attached to a blank message, but hasn't been sent. Send the photo.
