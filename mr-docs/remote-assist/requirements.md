# Requirements for deploying and using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

[!INCLUDE[try-guides-ra](../includes/try-guides-ra.md)]

To deploy and use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, make sure you meet the following technical requirements.

## Device requirements

Review the supported devices and device requirements for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.

### Supported devices

The Dynamics 365 Remote Assist application is supported on:

- [HoloLens](/hololens/hololens1-hardware)
- [HoloLens 2](/hololens/hololens2-hardware)
- Qualifying [Android](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices) mobile phones or tablets
- Qualifying [iOS](https://www.apple.com/augmented-reality/) mobile phones and tablets

Individuals without the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app can join a [Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call](./mobile-app/making-calls-on-remote-assist-mobile.md) using the Teams application on a [Windows 10 PC or Mac](teams-pc-all.md), or [mobile device](teams-mobile-all.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Accuracy of annotations is highly dependent on the capabilities of the device. Use Android devices that have a time-of-flight (ToF) sensor and support the [Depth API](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices) and iOS devices that have a LiDAR sensor [(see LiDAR sensor in the tables listed for iOS and iPadOS devices)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_and_iPadOS_devices) for a better augmented reality (AR) experience.

### Device options and requirements for a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user

| Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on mobile devices          | Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile is available on all devices, including ARCore-enabled Android phones or tablets, ARKit-enabled iOS iPhones or iPads, and mobile devices without AR support. <p><p>**For Android devices, the minimum operating system required is Android 7.0. For iOS devices, the minimum operating system required is iOS 12.2.**                                                                              | See [Android AR-supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices), [iOS ARCore-supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices#ios), or [Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile calls on mobile devices without AR support](./mobile-app/calls-using-devices-without-ar.md).                                         |
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on a non-Windows device, the operating system of the device processes some personal data to enable push and incoming call notifications. Microsoft may, accordingly, send data to the external, third-party notification services so users can see who is calling or be notified of a chat message. Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification services are not provisioned in a dedicated data center for exclusive use by you and are governed by their own service-specific terms and privacy statements, which you should carefully review.

## Licensing and product requirements per role

Review the licensing and product requirements by user role.

### Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app user

A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license includes the following three products:

- Dynamics 365 Remote Assist
- Microsoft Teams
- Microsoft Dataverse

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamics 365 Remote Assist [supports a subset of Microsoft Teams policies](teams-policies.md).

| **Included with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license** | **What capabilities are available?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Teams**             | Use calling features through the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app on HoloLens or mobile devices. Features include: </br> - Make a call </br> - Use mixed-reality annotations                                            |
| **Microsoft Dataverse**                 | - Access to the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist model-driven app </br> - [Create and manage assets](./asset-capture-overview.md) either within or outside a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call </br> - Create and share one-time call links </br> - See analytics and insights based on your call records |

An Azure Active Directory account is also required for purchasing the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist subscription and for assigning licenses. You'll need an Azure AD account for each licensed user. They'll use this account when signing in to the app.

> [!Note]
> The Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, Teams, and Dataverse licenses must be assigned to a native member of the tenant ([Azure AD member](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users) account). Dynamics 365 Remote Assist does not support [Azure AD B2B](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b); an individual cannot sign into Dynamics 365 Remote Assist using a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license assigned to an Azure AD guest account.

### Administrator

[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) account to assign licenses in Microsoft 365 admin portal and distribute applications through Microsoft Store for Business. [Learn more about how to deploy Dynamics 365 Remote Assist](deploy-remote-assist.md).

## Network requirements

A variety of network conditions, including bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss, can impact your video calling experience. Although audio and video calls might be possible in environments with reduced bandwidth, you might experience feature degradation.

### Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

When using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on mobile devices:
- A minimum of 1.5 Mbps up/down is required for peer-to-peer HD quality video calling with resolution of HD 720p at 15fps.

If Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile autodetects that the technician is experiencing [poor network conditions](./mobile-app/poor-network-connectivity.md#poor-network-connectivity-is-determined-by-the-following-conditions), it will prompt the technician to share high-quality snapshots instead of transmitting a low-quality live video feed. See [Calls in low bandwidth](mobile-app/poor-network-connectivity.md) for more information.

### Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens

When using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens:
- A minimum of 1.5 Mbps up/down is required for peer-to-peer HD-quality video calling with resolution of HD 1080p at 30 fps.
- For **optimal** peer-to-peer HD-quality video calling with resolution of HD 1080p, 4-5 Mbps up/down is required. In some circumstances, such as using the first gen HoloLens, even 4-5 Mbps up/down does not guarantee 1080p video calling at full quality.

### URLs and ports

Review the *minimum* URL end points and TCP/UDP ports utilized by Dynamics 365 Remote Assist. All must be reachable from the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app. If you have specialized needs or scale, see the [Teams comprehensive list](/microsoftteams/prepare-network).

> [!NOTE]
> US Government Community Cloud (GCC) environments require additional URLs to be added to the allowlist. For more information, see the following topics:

### Network optimization recommendations

Potential optimizations for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist include:

- [Monitor your network using CQD and call analytics](/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network#best-practice-monitor-your-network-using-cqd-and-call-analytics).
- Review Teams' recommendations [for optimizing your network](/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network#network-optimization).
- Be on a dedicated SSID. The dedicated SSID should be on the 5-Ghz band only; disable 2.4 Ghz.
- Use a router with MU-MIMO capabilities.

### Additional resources

- Troubleshoot and address internal infrastructure issues using [Teams Call Analytics](/MicrosoftTeams/use-call-analytics-to-troubleshoot-poor-call-quality#troubleshoot-call-quality-problems-using-call-analytics) or [Teams Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)](/MicrosoftTeams/quality-of-experience-review-guide).
