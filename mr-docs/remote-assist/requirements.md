## Network requirements

The recommended bandwidth for optimal performance of [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] is 1.5 mbps.
Though audio/video calls might be possible in environments with reduced
bandwidth, you might experience [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] feature degradation, limiting the user
experience. To test your company’s network bandwidth, follow these steps:

1.  Have a [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] user start a video call with another [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] user.

2.  Add a separate video call between a third and fourth user, and another for a
    fifth and sixth user.

3.  Continue adding video callers to stress-test your network bandwidth until
    you’re confident that multiple users can successfully connect on video calls
    at the same time.

Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network) to learn
