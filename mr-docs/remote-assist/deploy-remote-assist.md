# Deploy Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

[!INCLUDE[try-guides-ra](../includes/try-guides-ra.md)]

After you get your [free trial](try-remote-assist.md) or [purchase](buy-remote-assist.md) Dynamics 365 Remote Assist or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist Attach (for Field Service customers), deploy it to your organization. To deploy:

- IT Admins assign licenses to users in your organization
- Individual users in your organization download and install the app on a [supported device](./requirements.md)

You can also [deploy to multiple tenants](multi-tenant-deployment.md) or [enable vendors and contractors to use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist](vendor-use-RA.md).

## Add users and assign licenses

There are two types of users for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist Attach:

- Field service technicians who require a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license, which also includes the required Microsoft Teams license.
- Remote experts (who aren't in the field) require only a Microsoft Teams license.

### Prerequisites

Your organization must have:

- A Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 [administrator account](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/office-365-administration). [Learn more about admin permissions](/office365/admin/admin-overview/admin-overview).
