# Review tutorial for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens

The first time you use Remote Assist on HoloLens, you'll see a brief tutorial about the core features of the app. 

To see this tutorial at any time, launch Remote Assist and select **Settings** in the top-right corner. Select the **Links** tab. In the **Account** section, you'll see a question mark icon next to a link called **Run Tutorial**.
