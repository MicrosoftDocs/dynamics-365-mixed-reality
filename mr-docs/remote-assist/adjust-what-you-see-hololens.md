# Adjust what you see in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens or Hololens 2

[!INCLUDE[try-guides-ra](../includes/try-guides-ra.md)]

In this article, we'll walk through a few ways you can adjust what you're seeing in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens or HoloLens 2:

1. Position the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist window
2. Switch the displayed video feed
3. View a Microsoft Teams user’s desktop or mobile screen

## Position the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist window

You can pin the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist window in your space, or you can have it follow you around. After you launch the application, you may want to pin the window to your left or right so you can focus on the task in front of you.

The pin icon, represented as ![Illustration of the pin icon in HoloLens.](media/RAHL_Pin.png "Pin"), fixes the window in a specific location in your space, not at a fixed distance from you. Unpin will enable the window to follow you at a fixed distance. No matter where you are and whether the window is pinned or unpinned, it will face you.

To pin and unpin the window:
- Select the **Pin icon**, or say "Remote Assist, Pin." To have the window follow you again, say select the **Unpin option**, or say "Remote Assist, Unpin."
- If you walk away from a pinned window and can't see it, you can say "Remote Assist, Unpin" and it will fly to wherever you are.

## Switch the displayed video feed

As the HoloLens or HoloLens 2 user, you can only see one remote collaborator’s video feed at a time. There are two ways to switch the displayed video feed in a group call or meeting.

1. You can switch video feeds from the **Participant Tray** located below the video feed. Select an avatar to switch to their outgoing video feed (or avatar, if their outgoing video is disabled).
2. Another method is to select **Open Participants**, represented as: ![Illustration of the Open Participants icon.](media/RAHL_Participants.png "OpenParticpants"), or say "Remote Assist, Open Participants". Select the participant whose video feed you want to switch to. If that participant's video feed is enabled, the video will switch to their outgoing video feed (or avatar, if their outgoing video is disabled).

## View a Teams user’s desktop or mobile screen  

The remote collaborator can share their desktop or application window with you to assist with the call. When they share their desktop or application window this way, their outgoing video feed, which is typically shown on the video card, will be disabled. The video card will display the collaborator’s avatar instead, and their screen will appear as a new window. To move, size, or close the window, use the controls at the top right of the window.

You'll still be able to use all the tools on the video card even though you are no longer seeing your collaborator’s video feed. Your collaborators will still be able to see what you’re looking at unless you turn off outgoing video feed.
