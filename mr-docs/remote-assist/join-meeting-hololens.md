# Join a meeting or live event on HoloLens

A [Microsoft Teams meeting](/microsoftteams/quick-start-meetings-live-events) is a meeting scheduled using Teams involving any number of participants. Meetings are useful for maintenance and repairs that are scheduled in advance. They are also useful for inspections and other recurring scenarios.

[Microsoft Teams live events](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events) are an extension of Teams meetings, enabling users to broadcast video and meeting content to a large online audience. These events are meant for one-to-many communications where the host of the event is leading the interactions and audience participation is primarily to view the content shared by host.

A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user can join a live event as a presenter or attendee in the same way they join a meeting.

> [!Note]
> If a remote collaborator joins a meeting, you will not receive a call or notification, regardless of whether you are in the app. You must select **Join Meeting** (or say "Remote Assist, Join meeting") to join the meeting. In addition, calling the participants involved in a scheduled meeting will not enable you to join the meeting; you must actually join the meeting.

If for some reason you're unable to join the meeting, you may also ask the Teams user to join the meeting and use the **Open Participants** feature to call you. You'll receive an incoming call notification. Accept the call using audio or video, and you will join the meeting.

To join a meeting, select **Join Meeting**, or say "Remote Assist, Join Meeting", below the **Recent Contacts** screen. The **Join Meeting** button appears if the meeting is happening now or within the next 15 minutes. If your upcoming meetings overlap, you can use the arrows to select which meeting to join.  

After you join a meeting, you or the Teams user can add more people to the meeting. Select **Open Participants** (as represented by this icon: ![Graphic showing the open participants icon.](media/RAHL_Participants.png)). You'll see the first person you called on the left side of the video card, and a list of participants on the right side of the video card. On the bottom of the video card, there's a text field. Select the text field, and a holographic keyboard will pop out. A list of your recent contacts will appear. If the person you'd like to call isn't on the list, enter a name or email address using the holographic keyboard, and then select a name in the search results to start the call.

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamics 365 Remote Assist supports the Teams lobby on HoloLens. A HoloLens user can now admit a Teams guest into a meeting.
