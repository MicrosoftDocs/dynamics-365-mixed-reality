# Voice commands and gestures for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens

## Voice commands

You can navigate Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens and HoloLens 2 using voice commands and gaze instead of gestures. Some voice commands are contextual, so they only work in particular areas of the user interface. For example, “Start inking” only works if the ink tool is already active.” You can also look at any button and say “Select.”

At this time, voice commands and speech recognition are [available in specific languages for Hololens](./faq-hololens.md#what-languages-are-voice-commands-and-speech-recognition-available-for).

When you’re in a call, a good way to learn the features of Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is to say, “Remote Assist.” The app will display what it believes you said by showing a check mark and “Remote assist.” Then, the app will display the name of each button, as you see in the image above. After a few seconds, these labels will automatically disappear. 

When you’re outside a call (for example, before you’ve picked up, or when you’re looking at list of contacts but have not called anyone), you can also say “Remote Assist” to remind yourself of the voice command for each button you see. The labels will pop up for a few seconds, and then disappear. However, you will not receive confirmation of your voice command. 
For full list of voice commands, see the list below.


> [!Note]
> To use a voice command, say “Remote Assist,” and then say one of the voice commands in the following table. For example, say "Remote Assist, Move" to enter Move mode for a slate (window). You can also gaze at any button and say “Remote Assist, Select” to select that button.

## Use the Narrator to announce incoming calls

You can turn on the Narrator if you want to take advantage of voice narration for incoming calls. When you turn on incoming call narration, in addition to displaying the incoming caller's name, the caller's name is announced. You can then say "Remote Assist, Video," "Remote Assist, Audio," or "Remote Assist, Ignore," to respond to the incoming call.

To turn on the Narrator for incoming calls:

- Go to Settings, and then select the **On** button for the Narrator.

## Gestures

The April 2021 release of Dynamics 365 Remote Assist improved gestures on HoloLens 2 to make them more instinctual:

- Improved audio and visual cues make it easier to grab, move, and resize windows, whether you’re directly manipulating windows up close or manipulating them from a distance with hand rays.

- Improvements to the near finger cursor make it easier to grab windows and select buttons.
