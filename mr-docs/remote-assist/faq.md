## Where is Dynamics 365 Remote Assist available?

[!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)], which requires [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], is available worldwide.

Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States

## Why am I not getting incoming call notifications?

This can happen if you’re signed in to [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] with a different account
than the one you used to sign in to your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)]. Make sure you’re signed in to
both the app and the device with the same account. 

## I see a message saying I have no internet connection.

To use [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)], you need a Wi-Fi connection. Make sure your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] is
[connected to Wi-Fi](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12629).

## Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is frozen or unresponsive.

Try closing and reopening [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)]. If you’re still having problems,
[restart your HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12642).

## Dynamics 365 Remote Assist isn't showing my contacts.

If you don’t see the contacts you expect, try the following:

-   Make sure you’ve signed in to [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] at least once with the account
    you’re using on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

-   Close and reopen [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)].

-   [Restart your HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12642).

## The Mixed Reality toolbar doesn’t appear on the PC Teams client during a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call.

This might happen if [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] has downloaded a new version of the client in the
background but is still running the older version of the app. Restarting your PC
will usually fix this issue.

## Why does audio sometimes cut out even in quiet environments?

If [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] is used in a loud environment, use headphones on both ends for
better communication. Using headphones for both users prevents any echo
filtering from proactively turning on noise cancellation, which turns off audio.

## Can I use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to place a call between two separate tenants?

Yes, but only if the expert is calling as a guest on the other user’s tenant.
Currently, [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] doesn’t support two users calling each other even if
two tenants are joined by federation.

## Does Microsoft Teams include the same Dynamics 365 Remote Assist features on all platforms and devices?

No. Ink, arrows, and adding files are only available on [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] for PC.

## I signed in to my HoloLens, but I still can't sign in to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.

If you’re having trouble signing in to [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)], try the following:

-   Make sure you’re using a work or school account, not a [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] account, to
    sign in to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

-   Make sure that the work or school account you’re using has a valid [Office
    365 Business](https://products.office.com/business/office) Premium or
    Essentials subscription with [Microsoft
    Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)
    enabled.

-   Make sure your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] is connected to the internet.

-   Check with your administrator to make sure your device and network are set
    up to work with [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)].

## How do I set up Dynamics 365 Field Service to work with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist?
