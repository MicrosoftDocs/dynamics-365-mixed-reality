# Send text messages in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens


You can send text messages with other call participants.

To open the chat window and enter a message:

- Select **Chat icon** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the open chat icon.](media/RAHL_Text.png )), or say "Remote Assist, Open Chat."
- Select the text preview field at the bottom of the chat window. This will bring up the holographic keyboard. Then:
  - Select characters in the holographic keyboard. If you’re on HoloLens 2, you can directly tap each key.
  - Select **Microphone**, and then dictate your message. HoloLens will convert the message into text.
  - Connect a Bluetooth keyboard directly to the HoloLens and type your message.
  - Select **Send**. 
- When the chat window is open, you can detach it from the video card by selecting **Undock**, or by saying "Remote Assist, Undock."
- You can then place the chat window wherever you'd like.
  - If you're on HoloLens, use the slate controls found in the top-right corner of the slate. 
  - If you're on HoloLens 2, grab the slate with one hand, move your hand to the desired location, and then release.
- To attach the text chat to the video card, select **Redock**, or say "Remote Assist, Redock."  
- To close the chat window, select **Chat icon**, or say "Remote Assist, Open Chat."

To scroll up in the chat: 

- If you're using HoloLens:
  - Gaze at the content of the app window. Tap and hold and then move your hand slightly upwards or downwards to scroll the content.
- If you're using HoloLens 2:
  - If the chat window is near you, scroll content by swiping on the surface of the content with your finger, just like you're using a touch screen.
  -	If the chat window is out of your reach, air tap and hold on the content and then move your hand ray up and down or side to side.


> [!Note]
> If a message is sent from another user when the chat window isn’t open, a red dot will appear on the **Chat icon**, but your chat window will not automatically open.

During a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call, you will only see text messages and links to snapshots sent during the call. After a call ends, you can access the text messages and links in the Teams chat log.
