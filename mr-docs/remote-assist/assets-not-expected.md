# The asset records I see aren't what I expected

In the HoloLens app, when I select the **Assets** tab, the assets I see aren't what I expected to see.

## Cause

You might have access to more than one environment with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist installed.

## Solution

1. Select **Settings** > **Dynamics 365 environment**.

1. Select the environment you want from the list.

1. Select the **Assets** tab.

1. Select **Retry**, if prompted.
