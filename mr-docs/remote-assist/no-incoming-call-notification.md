# Incoming call notifications aren't received

## Symptoms

When working in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on a HoloLens, I'm not getting notifications when I receive an incoming call.

## Cause

You might be signed in to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist with a different account than the one you used to sign in to your HoloLens.

## Resolution

Make sure youâ€™re signed into both the app and the device with the same account.
