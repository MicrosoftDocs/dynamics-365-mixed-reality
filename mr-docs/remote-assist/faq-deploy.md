## What are the technical requirements for deploying Dynamics 365 Remote Assist?

Learn about the technical requirements [here](requirements.md).

## Can I use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to collaborate with a Microsoft Teams user outside my tenant, or vice versa?

Yes. Learn how to [set up multi-tenant company deployments](multi-tenant-deployment.md), [enable vendors and contractors to use Remote Assist](vendor-use-ra.md), or [enable vendors and contractors to use Teams](vendor-use-teams.md).

## How do I set up Dynamics 365 Field Service to work with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist?

To learn how to set up Dynamics 365 Field Service integration with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist so that a firstline worker can call an expert in the context of a Field Service booking, see [Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist](troubleshoot-field-service.md).

Yes. Anyone that can sign in and use the Teams application on a Windows 10 PC or mobile device can communicate with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user if their tenants are set up correctly. If the Teams user and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user are not in the same tenant, learn how to [set up multi-tenant company deployments](multi-tenant-deployment.md), [enable vendors and contractors to use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist](vendor-use-ra.md), or [enable vendors and contractors to use Teams](vendor-use-teams.md).
