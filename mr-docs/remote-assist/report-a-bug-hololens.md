# Report a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist bug using HoloLens Feedback Hub

If you encounter an issue, use the HoloLens Feedback Hub to let us know so we can resolve it in future releases.

There are two ways to get to the HoloLens Feedback Hub application to report a bug. 

1. From the **Start menu**: At any time, you can go to the **Start menu** and launch **Feedback Hub**. 
2. From Dynamics 365 Remote Assist: If you just ended a call and are in the **Call tab**, select the **Settings tab** from the left navigation. Select the **Links** sub tab, and in the **Links** section, select **Feedback Hub** to launch **Feedback Hub**.

When you're in the HoloLens Feedback Hub: 

1. From the home tab (represented by this icon![Graphic showing the home icon](media/RAHL_FeedbackHubHome.png), select **Report a problem**, as seen in the following screenshot.

1. In the **Enter your feedback** section, summarize your feedback. To type, tap the text field and a holographic keyboard will appear. Then, select **Next**. To edit your response to any step after you’ve chosen **Next**, select **Edit**, which is to the top right of the text field. 
2. In the **Choose a category** section, categorize the issue using "Apps" and "Microsoft Remote Assist." To select an item in the drop-down menu, select the menu.
   - If you're using HoloLens 1, scroll by gazing at the content of the app window. Tap and hold and then move your hand slightly upwards or downwards to scroll the content.
   - If you're using HoloLens 2, scroll by placing your finger on the drop-down menu and move your finger up and down, as you would on a touch screen device.

1. In the **Find similar feedback** section, select "Make new bug."
2. In the **Additional details** section:
   - Optionally select "Consider this a blocking issue."  
   - Categorize your problem.
3. Select **Recreate your problem**:
   - Select **Start recording**.
   - Use the start menu to launch Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and replicate the issue.
   - When you're finished replicating the issue, use the start menu to return to **Feedback Hub**.
   - Select **End recording**.
   - Diagnostic data, a video, and audio from the recording will be attached. You may remove each one if you want to. 

> [!Note]
> Optionally, check the "This is blocking me" box if the issue is blocking you from completing your work or tasks.
