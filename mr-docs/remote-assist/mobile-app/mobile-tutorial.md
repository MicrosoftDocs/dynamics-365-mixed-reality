# Use the in-app tutorial on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

Technicians can use the in-app, guided tutorial in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile to jump-start their ability to use the app's augmented reality (AR) capabilities. With AR, technicians can share their real-world environments and connect with remote collaborators to walk through repair or inspection processes. Both call participants can reference objects and provide instructions by placing mixed-reality annotations into the technician's shared environment.

Use the guided tutorial to:

- Learn how to move your device around so that the app can detect your surroundings and surfaces for a better mixed-reality annotation placement experience.

- Place and manipulate mixed-reality annotations, such as arrows and drawings.

## Prerequisites

- To follow along with this guide, you should have a mobile device with ARCore or ARKit support. [Learn more about device requirements](../requirements.md)

> [!Note]
> No AR capabilities? No problem! Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile is also available on unsupported AR mobile devices. [Learn more about using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile on devices without AR](./calls-using-devices-without-AR.md)

## How it works

1. To launch the tutorial, on the **Sign in** screen, select **Try it**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you're already signed in and want to start the tutorial, go to **Menu** > **Learn the tools**.

2. When you start the tutorial, you're prompted to move your phone side-to-side for better surface detection.

3. Select the **Arrow** tool.

8. Practice placing and using other annotations. Try the **Color picker**, **Undo**, or **Delete all** annotation buttons.

## Techniques to improve surface detection

- Move your phone from side-to-side at the beginning of a video call. Move your phone slowly.
- Place annotations in your device's field of view.
- Avoid sudden movements.
- Avoid minimizing the app frequently and reopening it while there are annotations present.
- Maintain at least one foot of distance between your mobile device and the object you're annotating.

## Limitations that may hinder accurate surface detection

- Flat surfaces without texture, such as a white desk
- Environments with dim lighting or very bright lighting
- Transparent or reflective surfaces like glass
- Dynamic or moving surfaces

## What happens if the app loses tracking?

Throughout the tutorial or during a call, you may see a message that says the app has lost tracking because it can't adequately detect your surroundings or surfaces. In this case, you won't be able to place mixed-reality annotations until your surfaces are detected, and remote collaborators won't be able to place mixed-reality annotations in your shared space. 

Here are a few tips to help you bettter track your environment:

- Move your device from side-to-side to better detect your surroundings or surfaces.

- Move your device farther away.

    It's good to maintain at least one foot of distance between your mobile device and the object you're annotating.

- Move your device closer.

- Turn on lights to brighten dimly lit spaces.
