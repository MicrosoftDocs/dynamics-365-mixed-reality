# Make Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile calls with augmented reality supported devices

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile makes conducting repairs and remote inspections easy by providing technicians with the ability to launch one-to-one video calls with remote collaborators inside or outside of their organization. Experts can also use the mobile app to add annotations.

Calls with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile is available for calls between:

- Two Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile users
- A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user and a Teams desktop user
- A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user and a Teams mobile user

> [!NOTE]
> The following scenarios are **not** supported on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile at this time:
>
> - Making calls to browser-based Teams.
> - Participating in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens calls.

## Prerequisites

- In order to follow along with this guide, you must use a mobile device with ARCore or ARKit support. [Learn about Dynamics 365 Remote Assist's device requirements](../requirements.md).
- Technicians must have a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist [subscription](../buy-remote-assist.md).
- Remote collaborators must have Dynamics 365 Field Service or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist or Microsoft Teams [free trial or subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software).

3. Select the remote collaborator's name, and then select **Launch Call**.
