# Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile overview

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist enables technicians with mobile devices to connect with a remote collaborator on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile or Microsoft Teams (desktop or mobile). Using live video calling, mixed-reality annotations, and high-resolution snapshots, they can share what they see with the remote collaborator to troubleshoot problems together, faster.
