# Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile overview

[!INCLUDE [ra-mobile-deprecate-include](../../includes/ra-mobile-deprecate.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist enables technicians with mobile devices to connect with a remote collaborator on Microsoft Teams (desktop or mobile). Using live video calling, mixed-reality annotations, and high-resolution snapshots, they can share what they see with the remote collaborator to troubleshoot problems together, faster.
