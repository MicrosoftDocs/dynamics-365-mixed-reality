# Call another Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user from Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

Technicians using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile can call and collaborate with their peers who are also using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile. This article shows how to do one-to-one calls. See the following articles for different mobile app scenarios:

- [Collaborate with colleagues on Microsoft Teams desktop or Teams mobile](remote-assist-mobile-to-teams-calls.md)
- [Participate in group calls](group-calling.md)


## Prerequisites

- Call receivers with an iOS mobile device must **not** have the Microsoft Teams application on the device. Call receivers with an Android mobile device must choose Remote Assist Mobile for answering calls by [disabling Teams Mobile call notifications](remote-assist-mobile-to-teams-calls.md#what-happens-when-dynamics-365-remote-assist-mobile-and-teams-mobile-are-installed-on-the-same-device). 

- Technicians must have a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist [subscription](../buy-remote-assist.md).

- Remote collaborators must have Dynamics 365 Field Service or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and a Microsoft Teams [free trial or subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). Learn how to set up Dynamics 365 Remote Assist with [Teams desktop](../teams-pc-all.md) and [Teams mobile](../teams-mobile-all.md).

## Call another Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the remote collaborator is receiving the call on an iOS mobile device with both Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile and Teams mobile installed, the remote collaborator can only answer on Teams mobile.

1. If the remote collaborator answers the call on **Remote Assist mobile**, the technician's live video feed is shared to the remote collaborator's device screen.

1. Either call participant can place annotations directly in the shared environment (their own environment) or by selecting **Start annotating**. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > After the remote collaborator selects **Start annotating**, they can add mixed-reality annotations on a frozen frame of the shared environment. When they select the **Check mark** button, the annotation appears in the technician's shared environment.
