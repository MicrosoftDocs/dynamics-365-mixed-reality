# Overview of making calls with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

[!INCLUDE [ra-teams-mobile-include](../../includes/ra-teams-mobile.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile makes conducting repairs and remote inspections easy by providing technicians with the ability to launch video calls with remote collaborators inside or outside of their organization. Technicians can join one-to-one video calls and group video calls with three or more participants.

## Supported calling scenarios

A one-to-one call includes two participants. For example, if you're repairing a machine and need help on-the-go, you might make a one-to-one call to a remote collaborator who is using Microsoft Teams desktop or Teams mobile.

A group call is an ad-hoc call that includes three or more participants. For example, if you're inspecting an asset in a one-to-one call but need a third person's expertise, you (or the other participant on the call) can add a third person to create a group call.

The following table shows the types of calls supported on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile and whether one-to-one or group calls are supported for each.
