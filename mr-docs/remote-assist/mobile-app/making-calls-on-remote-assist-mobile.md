# Make Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile calls

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile makes conducting repairs and remote inspections easy by providing technicians with the ability to launch video calls with remote collaborators inside or outside of their organization. Technicians can join one-to-one video calls and group video calls with three or more participants. 

## Supported scenarios
Making calls with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile is **available** in these scenarios:

1. A call with two or more Remote Assist mobile users *(one-to-one call or group call)*
2. A call with two or more Remote Assist HoloLens users *(one-to-one call or group call)*
3. A call with two or more Teams desktop users *(one-to-one call or group call)*
4. A call with one Teams mobile user *(one-to-one call only)*
5. A call between **any combination of** at least three or more Remote Assist mobile users, Remote Assist HoloLens users, or Teams desktop users *(group call only)* 

> [!NOTE]
> The following calling scenarios are **not** supported on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile at this time:
>
> - Making calls to browser-based Teams.
> - Participating in a group call with Teams mobile users. 

## Definitions 
A **one-to-one call** includes two participants. For example, if you're repairing a machine and need help on-the-go, you can make a one-to-one call to a remote collaborator who uses Teams.

A **group call** is an adhoc call that includes three or more participants. For example, if you're inspecting an asset in a one-to-one call but need a third person's expertise, any participant can add the third person to the call to form a group call.
