# Dynamics 365 Remote Assist for mobile user guide

[!include[cc-microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] for mobile extends the capabilities of [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] to work with [!include[tn-android](../../includes/tn-android.md)] or iOS phones or tablets (in addition to [!include[cc-microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)]  [!include[pn-HoloLens](../../includes/pn-HoloLens.md)]). Technicians can use their phone or tablet to connect and collaborate with an 
expert on [!include[pn-microsoft-teams](../../includes/pn-microsoft-teams.md)]. Using live video calling and annotations, they can share what they see with the expert to troubleshoot problems together, faster.

- An internet connection. At least 1.5 MB of bandwidth is recommended for the best experience.

If you want to use [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] together with [!include[pn-dyn-365-field-service](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] so you can automatically log call information to a [!include[pn-field-service](../../includes/pn-field-service.md)] work order, you’ll also need one or both of the following:

## Make a call
After signing in, you’ll see the **Contacts** page, which is the main page in [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] for mobile. On the **Contacts** page, 
your contacts are organized by the most recent calls.

![Contacts screen.](media/contacts.png "Contacts screen")

To make a call:

1.	Select ![Search button.](../media/search-icon.PNG "Search button"), enter the name of the contact to search for, and then select the contact from the resulting list.
       
    ![Search for a contact.](../media/search-contact.PNG "Search for a contact")
    
2.	In the contact card, select **Launch Call**.

    ![Launch Call screen.](media/launch-call.png "Launch Call screen")
  
    Use the buttons in the bar at the bottom of the screen to mute the call, pause the video feed, turn on the speaker phone, or 
    end the call.
    
    ![Call controls.](media/call-controls.PNG "Call controls")
    
    A. Pause video feed<br>
    B. Mute call<br>
    C. Turn on speaker phone<br>
    D. End call
  
 
## Add annotations
You can add annotations to your screen to share with an expert on the call. To create annotations, your phone or tablet needs to recognize 
at least one plane (vertical or horizontal) in your work area. You do this by scanning your work area with the phone or tablet. When a plane has been recognized, you’ll see a confirmation visualization and the annotation toolbar will appear at the top of the screen:

![Add annotations.](media/annotation-bar-full-screen.PNG "Add annotations")
  
> [!NOTE] 
> If you lock your phone or tablet, or minimize [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] for mobile, the recognized planes will reappear automatically as soon as your phone or tablet recognizes the environment.

### Add an augmented reality annotation

You can add an augmented-reality annotation by using the buttons on the annotation toolbar:

![Annotation bar.](media/annotation-bar.PNG "Annotation bar")

A. Add arrow<br>
B. Add ink<br>
C. Change color of arrow or ink<br>
D. Undo last action<br>
E. Delete everything on screen, including expert's annotations
  
For example, to add an arrow, tap the arrow tool and drag your finger to the spot where you want to place the arrow.

### Add a 2D annotation

You can also annotate in 2D by toggling augmented reality off or by taking a picture.

![Camera button.](media/camera-button.PNG "Camera button")

When augmented reality is turned off, the **Camera** button turns into a check mark. 

![2D check mark.](media/2d-checkmark.png "2D check mark")

You might want to use 2D:

- To increase performance and save battery.

- To increase accuracy of annotations.

- If your device does not support augmented reality.

### Make the expert’s video feed bigger

When you call an expert, the expert’s video feed appears in the lower-right corner of your phone or tablet screen. To make the expert’s 
video feed bigger, tap the feed. Tap the feed again to return to the original size.

![Expert video feed.](media/expert-annotating.PNG "Expert video feed")
  
If the expert is annotating, a notification icon will appear on the expert's feed.  

## Switch the camera view from portrait to landscape

You can switch the orientation of the camera view from portrait to landscape while in a call by changing the orientation of your phone or tablet. Using landscape view provides a wider field of view, which may improve the experience for the remote expert on the call.

## Send a text message

You can also communicate through Teams chat with the person you're calling. A pop-up window appears for any messages you receive or you can open the text chat window to send a message to the other person. 

![Chat window.](media/chat.png "Chat window")
