# Integrate Dynamics 365 Remote Assist with Dynamics 365 Field Service  

If your organization uses Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage field service work orders, your first-line workers using Remote Assist on HoloLens can see their Field Service bookings and quickly call the remote collaborator listed in the booking's **Support Contact** field. 

By integrating Field Service and Remote Assist, you can: 

- Launch Remote Assist mobile directly from a Field Service Mobile booking via deeplinks.
- See relevant work order information.
- Post the Remote Assist call information to the associated work order's timeline.

In this article, we'll explore how a field technician can use the Remote Assist mobile app to make a call to an expert for help to complete a work order. We'll also explore the requirements to set up and use Remote Assist and Field Service together on the HoloLens.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following set-up:

- A [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-azure](../includes/pn-azure.md)] tenant with a [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] subscription **and** a [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] subscription. Both are requiredâ€”[!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] is not included in any [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] bundle.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > The tenant can have more than one [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] environment. [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] has the option to select an environment from within the app.

- You must have admin access to add or update the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] environment.

- The [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] environment must have the [!include[pn-dyn-365-field-service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] app installed, and it must include the **My Bookings for Today** view. To make sure this view is installed, we recommend [!include[pn-dyn-365-field-service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)] version 8.2 or later. This topic describes how to make sure you have the correct version and view.
    -  Please note the **My In Progress Bookings** view has been renamed to **My Bookings for Today.** This doc has been updated to reflect the name change. Depending on your version of [!include[pn-dyn-365-field-service](../includes/pn-dyn-365-field-service.md)], you may see either name. The functionality remains the same regardless of the view name.
- The tenant must have at least two user accounts - one for the technician (front-line worker) and another for the remote collaborator.
  - The remote collaborator only needs a Microsoft Teams license.
  - The technician user will need a Dynamics 365 Field Service license, a Microsoft Teams license, _and_ a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license. **Note:** A Remote Assist license includes Teams. 

## Set up technician user

First, create a bookable resource that will serve as the technician or front line worker that will use both Field Service on the Field Service Mobile app and Remote Assist on the Remote Assist mobile app on their phone or tablet.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a bookable resource in Field Service on a desktop](./media/remote-assist-field-service-resource.png)

The bookable resource must have a **Resource Type** set to **User**; the related user record will need licenses to use both Field Service Mobile and Remote Assist. To set up a field technician to use Field Service Mobile, see the Field Service docs article on [setting up Field Service users and security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/view-user-accounts-security-roles#set-up-a-field-technician-user).

Verify you can log into Field Service Mobile successfully as the field technician user.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a Field Service Mobile after logging in.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-fsm-login.png)
 
Next, verify you can log into the Remote Assist mobile app with the same user. Then:

Find and download the Remote Assist mobile app in the Apple iOS or Google Android app stores. 

Sign in as the same user that you logged in to Field Service Mobile with. If your technician has a Field Service license and a Teams license, then you can simply start a free trial of Dynamics 365 Remote Assist before buying.

> ![Screenshot of three mobile devices, showing the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app in an app store on the left. The middle device shows a logged in user. The device on the right shows a window prompting to get a free trial of Remote Assist.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-start-remote-assist-trial.png)

After signing in, make sure you enable Dynamics 365 integration. Select **Enable** from the popup, or go to **Settings**.

> [!Note]
> The Remote Assist mobile app is available on mobile devices running iOS and Android with the related ARkit or ARcore capabilities.
 

## Set up remote collaborator user

As a different user that you have identified as the remote collaborator, verify you can sign in to Microsoft Teams. This user does not need a Field Service or Remote Assist license.
   
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Teams on desktop.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-teams-signin.png)

> [!Note]
> The remote collaborator must log into the Microsoft Teams native app on his or her PC or mobile device. Teams on web is not supported.

## Create and schedule work orders

Next, create a work order to outline the onsite work the technician or front line worker needs to perform - typically an installation or an equipment or system repair. Enter a recommended expert in the **Support Contact** field that could be called via Remote Assist for support. Technicians won't be limited to only calling this contact.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a Field Service work order in a desktop, with attention to the support contact field.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-work-order-support-contact.png)

Schedule the work order to the bookable resource that represents the technician also known as the front line worker who travels to customer locations to complete work orders. In our example, Abraham McCormick is the bookable resource and we scheduled work orders to him with Resource Scheduling Optimization.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Abraham McCormick's booked work order on the Field Service schedule board, in a desktop window.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-work-order-schedule.png)


## View work orders on Field Service Mobile

Like any typical day, the technician logs in to Field Service Mobile and sees their assigned work orders for that day. If they need guidance from a remote collaborator who better knows the product, service, equipment, or account being serviced, they can launch the Remote Assist mobile app from the work order.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of four mobile devices showing Field Service Mobile, and the workflow that brings up the Remote Assist launching option.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-mobile.png)

> [!Note]
> The deep link from Field Service Mobile to the Remote Assist mobile app is currently available on Android only. Technicians using iOS devices must maually open Remote Assist mobile.


## Make a Remote Assist call

The support contact will be autoselected to call if Remote Assist was opened via the deep link; otherwise, the technician can search through the directory for Teams users inside or outside their organization.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of a mobile device showing the Launch Call option on a contact in Remote Assist.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-launch-call.png)


The remote collaborator will then receive the call, like any other Teams call.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of the incoming Remote Assist call to the remote collaborator, working in Teams desktop.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-receive-call-teams.png)

The technician can then begin to share what they see through their mobile device's camera, making annotations as needed.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Remote Assist on a mobile device, showing an arrow annotation.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-call-annotation.png)

From Teams, the remote collaborator can also make annotations. 

## Post Remote Assist Call to work order

After gaining the necessary guidance from the remote collaborator, the technician will end the call and be given the option to post the call as an activity to the work order time line.

Technicians can choose from a list of bookings they are scheduled for on the day of the call, which matches the **Agenda** view in Field Service Mobile.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Remote Assist on a mobile device, showing the option to select a booking to post to.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-call-post-to-work-order-choose-BOTH.png)

Back on the work order, the dispatcher can see a Remote Assist call took place.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Field Service on desktop, showing a work order with attention to the timeline, which now has a Remote Assist call listed.](./media/remote-assist-field-service-call-metadata-timeline.png)

Documenting the Remote Assist call on the work order is important because it lets managers know which types of issues are requiring extra help and can build training programs to accommodate.

## Set up and view Field Service bookings on HoloLens

If the technician is equipped with a HoloLens headset, then viewing and interacting with Field Service is even better. 

Technicians can:

- View today's bookings.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Screenshot of Remote Assist on HoloLens, showing active Field Service bookings.](./media/07.00-dynamics-bookings.png)

- View the work order and the recommended support contact field.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Screenshot of Remote Assist on HoloLens, showing the support contact on the booking.](./media/07.01-dynamics-booking.png)

- Attach images to the work order during the Remote Assist call so future stakeholders can see the work or problem.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Screenshot of a user attaching an image in Remote Assist on HoloLens.](./media/07.08-dynamics-save-prompt.png)

- Update booking statuses, like marking work as complete.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Screenshot of Remote Assist on HoloLens, showing the option to change the status of the booking.](./media/07.02-dynamics-booking-status.png)


### Set up Field Service for the HoloLens

1. Ensure you're using Field Service v8.2 or later. [Upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/upgrade-field-service#field-service) your solution if necessary. 
2. Confirm the **My Bookings for Today** view on the **Bookable Resource Booking** entity is included:

     - Go to **Field Service** > **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.

> [!Note]
> The **My In Progress Bookings** view has been renamed to **My Bookings for Today**. This doc has been updated to reflect the name change. Depending on your version of Dynamics 365 Field Service, you may see either name. The functionality remains the same regardless of the view name.

> ![Bookable Resource view](media/bookable-resource-views.PNG "Bookable Resource view")

> [!Note]
> Fields can be added to this view if necessary for your business needs.

3. Create and schedule a work order.

     - The booking will not appear in the Dynamics 365 pane in Remote Assist unless the booking status is **In progress** and the related bookable resource has a user record that matches the HoloLens user.
