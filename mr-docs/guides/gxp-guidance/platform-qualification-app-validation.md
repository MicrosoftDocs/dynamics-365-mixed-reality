# Platform qualification and app validation

Implementation of Dynamics 365 Guides in regulated industries has the following prerequisites:

- Qualify Microsoft Power Platform.
- Validate the Guides app.
- Validate Power Apps.

The requirements for qualification and validation vary by industry. This section is based on the requirements for life science, because that industry demands some of the highest levels of regulatory requirements. You might find that some of the requirements are relevant to your organization, even though it isn't in the life science industry.
