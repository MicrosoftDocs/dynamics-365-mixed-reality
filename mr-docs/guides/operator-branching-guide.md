# Use a branching (non-linear) guide in Dynamics 365 Guides 

Some guides created in Dynamics 365 Guides are linear in nature. You always go to the next step to complete the guide, and you can go back to the previous step if you need to review the step again. In other cases, an author might create a branching (non-linear) guide if the scenario requires a different set of steps based on a particular response from you. For example, in a training guide, you might need to follow a different set of steps based on your level of expertise:

To use a branching guide, simply select the most appropriate response to go to the approprate set of steps. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you select the **Back** button in a branching guide, you'll return to the last step you were on, similar to how history works in a web browser.
