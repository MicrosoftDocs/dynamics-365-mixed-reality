# Change from one anchor type to another in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

You can anchor a guide in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides by using a QR code anchor, circular code anchor, or holographic anchor. It's easy to change from one anchor type to another if a different anchor type will work better for your scenario. 

1. In the **Outline** page, select the anchor at the top of the page, or select the **Anchor** button in the left navigation pane to open the **Anchor** wizard.

    ![Anchor button and anchor.](media/change-anchor-method.PNG "Anchor button and anchor")

2. In the lower-left corner of the wizard window, select **Change anchor method**.

3. Select the anchor type that you want to change to.

4. In the warning message that appears, select **Switch anchor method**.
