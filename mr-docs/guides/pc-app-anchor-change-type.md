# Change from one anchor type to another in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

You can anchor a guide in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides by using an object anchor, a QR code anchor, circular code anchor, or holographic anchor. It's easy to change from one anchor type to another if a different anchor type will work better for your scenario.

1. In the **Outline** page, select the anchor at the top of the page, or select the **Anchor** button in the left navigation pane to open the **Anchor** wizard.

1. In the warning message that appears, select **Change anchor**.

1. Follow the steps based on the type of anchor you chose.
