# Anchor a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides by using a circular code anchor

Use a printed circular code anchor to anchor your guide to the real world in Guides. Review [best practices for circular code anchors.](pc-app-anchor-circular-best-practices.md)

## Set up a circular code anchor

You can access the **Anchor** wizard from the **Outline** page in the PC app. The **Outline** page automatically appears after you create or open a guide.

1. On the **Outline** page, select **Set your anchor now**.

1. On the **Choose an anchor method** page, under **Circular Code**, select **Select**.

1. In step 1 of the wizard, select **Download circular code** to create a PDF file that is named **Guides-CircularCodeAnchor**. This file includes the anchor that you will print in step 6.

1. On your computer, in Adobe Acrobat Reader, open the **Guides-CircularCodeAnchor** file.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Guides supports one size of circular code anchor. To ensure the best possible alignment accuracy, it's crucial that you print the anchor at the specified size. If you use Adobe Acrobat Reader, you can set the specified size to get the best printing results.

1. Select **File** \> **Print**, and then, under **Page Sizing & Handling**, select the **Actual size** option.

1. Print the last page of the document on matte stock and don't laminate it. Glossy materials can affect scanning and decreases the anchor detection rate. Bubble jet printers produce a better matte finish.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure the anchor is always positioned flat. Don't distort or place it on a curved surface as this negatively affects alignment and detection.

1. Make sure that the printed marker spacing matches the measurements shown in the following illustration as the size of the anchor can change depending on the printer used. The anchor measurements must be exact.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the anchor spacing isn't within +/â€“ 0.1 mm, in the **Print** dialog box, select the **Custom Scale** option, and then change the percentage to compensate for the size discrepancy. For example, if the result is 49 mm when you print the anchor, change the scale to 100.4 percent to get 49.196 mm, which is within tolerance.

1. Attach the circular code anchor to a physical object in the real world, and then take a picture to help the operator find it.

1. Go back to the **Anchor** wizard in the PC app, and then select **Next** two times. (You can skip step 2 of the wizard if you took a picture of the location in the previous step.)

1. In step 3 of the wizard, select **Import** to import the picture that you took in step 8. Then drag it to the **Import anchor placement photo** box. When you've finished, select **Next** to move to the next step.

   > [!TIP]
   > The filter is automatically set to **Images**, but you can change it.

1. In step 4 of the wizard, if you want to change the default instructions for the operator, select **Edit Step card text**, and then enter your instructions. When you've finished, select **Next** to move to the next step.
