# Use voice commands in Dynamics 365 Guides as a substitute for hand gestures or gaze

You can use voice commands in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides as a substitute for touch or gaze. Voice commands save you time and keep you in the flow of your work, because you don't have to gaze at buttons or touch them to take actions.

For increased accuracy, most voice commands are contextual. In other words, they work only when the appropriate page is open.

> [!NOTE]
> Voice commands work best on HoloLens 2. Although you can use voice commands on HoloLens 1, HoloLens 1 isn't optimized for voice in loud environments.

## Prerequisites

- Speech must be enabled on the device.

- You must give Dynamics 365 Guides permission to use your microphone during the first run of the app. Alternatively, go to **Settings** \> **Privacy** \> **Microphone**, and set the **Dynamics 365 Guides** option to **On**.

    ![Microphone settings.](media/microphone-permission.PNG "Microphone settings")

> [!NOTE]
> Voice commands are supported for [all languages that Dynamics 365 Guides supports](./faq.md#what-languages-is-dynamics-365-guides-available-in) except Swedish, Norwegian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Korean. The language is based on the Windows display language, not the keyboard language. You can verify the Windows display language by going to **Settings** \> **Time and Language** \> **Language**.

## Use voice commands

The sections below show Dynamics 365 Guides pages and the voice commands that you can use for each of them.

> [!TIP]
> Regardless of where you are in the app, the [Select](/hololens/hololens-cortana#general-speech-commands) voice command works like an air tap.
