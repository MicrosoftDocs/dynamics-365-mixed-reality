# Convert a trial version of Dynamics 365 Guides to a paid version

If you are on a trial version of Dynamics 365 Guides, you can [purchase a subscription](buy-guides.md) before your trial has ended and keep the content that you created during the trial.

## Prerequisites

You must purchase the required number of licenses.

## Convert from a trial to a paid version

Convert your trial version to a paid version using one of the following methods:

- If you want to convert your trial environment to a production environment, [convert the trial to prod.](/power-platform/admin/trial-environments#convert-either-type-of-trial-environment-to-a-production-environment)

- If you want to keep your data but create a new production environment, use the [Content Migration Tool](migrate.md) to move the data you want to keep.

## Next step

- [Assign licenses and add users](add-users.md)
