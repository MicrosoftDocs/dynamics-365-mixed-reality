# Package a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides

Packaging a guide creates a copy of all content in a guide that you can share with a user regardless of permission levels. Packaging a guide allows authors to create a self-contained, real-only file that can be shared with others.

<!--- Add benefits --->

The packaged guide can only be viewed by an operator with a HoloLens device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verify permissions on guide content before packaging a guide. Be aware of any sensitive information that might be shared and manage the packaged guide according to your organization's privacy policies.

1. In the PC app, open the guide you want to package and select **Package guide**.
