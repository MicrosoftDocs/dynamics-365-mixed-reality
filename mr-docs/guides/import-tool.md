[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

With [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)], you can create and import your own custom 3D parts using CAD models. [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] supports glTF, GLB, and FBX file formats. You can use a combination of third-party tools and the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] to prepare your 3D (CAD) models, or you can use the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)]’s concierge service to have [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] convert and optimize the models for you. For more information on the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], see these topics:
