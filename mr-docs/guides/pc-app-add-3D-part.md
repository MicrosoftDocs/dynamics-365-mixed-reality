# Add a custom 3D part to a step in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

You can add 3D parts (models specific to your company) in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides by importing them. A 3D part hologram helps operators find a 3D part in the real world. You can use a combination of third-party tools to prepare your 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models. For more information, see [Overview of preparing 3D models](./3d-content-guidelines/overview.md).

1. Open a step in a guide and select the **My files** tab.

## Import a custom 3D model to use as a 3D part

You can import your own custom 3D models and add them to **My files** or a folder in **My files**. To import files, you can drag them from a local file folder or use the **Import** command.

> [!TIP]
> You can set animation options (playback speed, direction, and looping) in the HoloLens app.
