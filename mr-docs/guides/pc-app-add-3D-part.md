# Add a custom 3D part (that you import) to a step in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

You can add 3D parts (models specific to your company) in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides. A 3D part hologram helps operators find a 3D part in the real world. You can import custom 3D parts as described in this article. 

1. In the PC app, on the right side of the page, select the **3D parts** tab.

2. Drag the 3D part that you want to one of the **3D parts** boxes.

> [!TIP]
> To find items that were recently added to the gallery, you can sort by name or by the date when the item was added.

## Import a custom 3D model to use as a 3D part

You can import your own custom 3D models and add them to the **3D parts** library. To import files, you can drag them from a local file folder or use the **Import** command.

> [!TIP]
> You can set animation options (playback speed, direction, and looping) in the HoloLens app. 

### Import a file by using a drag-and-drop operation

1. Open Windows File Explorer, and go to the folder that contains the 3D models that you want to import.

2. Drag the files to the gallery.
