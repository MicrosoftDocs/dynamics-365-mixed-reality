# Add an image or video to a step in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

You can add an image or video in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app to help an operator with a complex step. You could add a diagram, for example, or a short video to explain a difficult process. 

1. In the PC app, on the right side of the page, select the **Images** or **Videos** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> You can preview the image or video on the right side of the screen by selecting it (click or double-click) in the **Library**. 

## Change a video thumbnail

When you add a video to a step, the thumbnail for the video is automatically created. If you want to change the thumbnail to an image of your choice, you can use the Guides model-driven app. [Learn how to open the Guides model-driven app](open-model-driven-app.md). 

1. In the Guides model-driven app, open the video that has the thumbnail you want to replace.

    > The image will automatically update in the model-driven app. To refresh the image in the PC app **Step Editor** page, open the **Outline** page, and then go back to the **Step Editor** page.
