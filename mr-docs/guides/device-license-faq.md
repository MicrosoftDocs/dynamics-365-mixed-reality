# Licensing FAQ

- If you receive a sign-in error, confirm the shared account has been assigned the device license, and has been assigned the **Basic User** role and the **Operator** or **Restricted Operator** role.

- If you can't find the guide, you probably need to [assign](admin-access-assign.md) or [share](admin-access-teams.md) the guide to the shared account.

- If you're prompted to select **Author** or **Operator**, you probably assigned an incorrect role to the account, or you're not signed into the app with the right account.
