# Microsoft Dataverse table (entity) reference for Dynamics 365 Guides

When a guide is created with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides PC app, content and information in that guide are stored by using the 
Dynamics 365 Guides [tables](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/entity-overview) from [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) that are listed later in this topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All tables that are installed as part of the Dynamics 365 Guides solution support the standard extensibility/programming model in Dynamics 365. You can access table information by using either the [Web application programming interface (API)](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/overview) or the [Microsoft Dataverse Organization Service](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/org-service/overview).
>
> Dynamics 365 Guides tables and columns can be used with the Web API, and in [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) or a flow using [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/). However, we anticipate that these tables will evolve quickly in the near future. If you have an urgent need to do a business-critical integration, contact the Dynamics 365 Guides team directly for guidance, through your Microsoft Account team.
>
> Additionally, be careful when you programmatically create, update, or delete records for Dynamics 365 Guides tables. Some tables depend on other tables to provide user experiences and functionalities in the PC and HoloLens apps. Programmatic manipulation of these tables might prevent you from using the functionalities in the intended and supported way.
