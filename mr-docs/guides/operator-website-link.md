# Open a website, email, guide, or custom app from the Guides HoloLens app

If a Step card in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app includes a **Link** button, you can go to the link by selecting the button. For example, there might be a link to a parts diagram, the HoloLens settings app, or email. Websites are opened in the Microsoft HoloLens Edge browser. When you close the browser, you go back to the step that you were working on.

> [!NOTE]
> On HoloLens 1, the Dynamics 365 Guides app enters sleep mode when you select a link from a step. You can tap the Dynamics 365 Guides app at any time to return to the guide and resume where you left off. If you're using HoloLens 2, the Dynamics 365 Guides app remains active when you select a link.
