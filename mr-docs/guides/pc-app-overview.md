- [Select an anchoring method](pc-app-anchor.md).

- [Add tasks and steps](pc-app-step-editor-overview.md).

- Write the instructions for your steps. [Learn about best practices for writing instructional text](pc-app-step-editor-overview.md#best-practices-for-instructional-text-and-supporting-content).

  - 3D parts

  - 3D objects such as objects from the toolkit (holographic arrows and numbers, for example)

  - 2D media (images and videos)
