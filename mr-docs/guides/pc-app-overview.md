# Overview of authoring a guide with the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

![Video camera graphic](media/video-camera.PNG "Video camera graphic") [Watch a video about PC authoring](https://aka.ms/pcauthor)

You use the PC authoring app in [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] as the first step in the authoring process.

Use the PC app to complete these tasks:

- Create a guide.

- Select an anchoring method.

- Add tasks and steps.

- Write the instructions for your steps.

- Assign different types of content to support the steps. Here are some examples of supporting content:

    - 3D parts

    - 3D objects, such as objects from the 3D toolkit (for example, arrows and numbers)

    - 2D media (images and videos)
