You use the PC authoring app in [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] as the first step in the authoring process.

Use the PC app to complete these tasks:

- [Create a guide](create-guide.md).

- [Select an anchoring method](pc-app-anchor.md).

- [Add tasks and steps](pc-app-step-editor-overview.md).

- Write the instructions for your steps. [Learn about best practices for writing instructional text](pc-app-step-editor-overview.md#best-practices-for-instructional-text-and-supporting-content).

- [Assign different types of content to support the steps](pc-app-step-editor-overview.md). Here are some examples of supporting content:

    - 3D parts

    - 3D objects such as objects from the 3D toolkit (holographic arrows and numbers, for example)

    - 2D media (images and videos)
