# Add a website, email, guide, or app link to a step

Create a seamless workflow for operators by adding a website, email, guide, custom app, or Power Apps link to a **Step** card or a custom **Completion** step card in Dynamics 365 Guides. If you configure an action link with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme, the HoloLens opens the corresponding app or page when an operator activates the link.

To add a link to a custom **Completion** step card, first [add the custom completion step](#add-a-custom-completion-step), then choose the type of link to add. To add a link to a **Step** card, choose the type of link to add.

- [**Link**](#add-a-link-to-a-step): Add a link to a step so that operators can view and interact with information outside the guide. For example, connect a sequence of guides, open a website, open a page of the Settings app, or open a custom app that has been installed on the device.
- [**Power Apps link**](#add-a-power-apps-link-to-a-step): Add a Power Apps link to a step. [Power Apps](https://products.office.com/business/microsoft-powerapps) provides low-code tools that teams can use to create custom applications to solve unique business workflows. By combining Guides and Power Apps, you can extend Guides capabilities to create a more seamless end-to-end solution that fits the needs of your operators. For example, you can add a link to an interactive quiz app, an app for reordering parts, or an app that provides the latest status on Internet of Things (IoT) sensors.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To run Power Apps from Guides, operators need a [Power Apps license](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/). They must also have [permission](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/share-app#share-an-app) to view the app that is created in Power Apps.

## Add a custom completion step

The completion step is the final step in a guide. Create a completion step to let the operator know that they're at the end of the guide and can navigate to the custom app or resource of your choice. For example, if you have a custom launching app or landing page for Guides operators, use the completion step to tell them that the guide is complete and they can return to the landing page.

1. In the PC app, choose one:

   - To add a completion step at the end of a task, go to the task in the **Outline** page and select **Add step** > **Add a completion step**.

   - To add a completion step as a next step, go to the last step in the **Step Editor** page and select **Add step** > **Add a completion step**.

1. Choose one:

   - [Add a website, email, guide, or custom app](#add-a-link-to-a-step).

   - [Add a Power Apps link](#add-a-power-apps-link-to-a-step).

## Add a link to a step

To add a link to a step, you add an action. You can add one action per step. If a step already includes an action, any new action that you add overwrites the existing action.

1. In the PC app, go to the appropriate step, and then select the **Action** circle in the **Step Editor** pane.

1. Select **Website, Guide link, or other link** to perform the following actions. Enter the appropriate information in the **Link** field.

    - **Email**: Enter *mailto:* and then the email address.
    - **Guide or step**: [Create and copy a link to a guide or step](pc-app-copy-link-guide-step.md).
    - **Web page**: Enter the web address, starting with *http:* or *https:*.
    - **A HoloLens settings page**: Enter *ms-settings:\<URI\>*, where \<*URI*\> is the [URI of the appropriate settings page for HoloLens](/hololens/settings-uri-list#settings-uris) in the Settings app. For example, enter *ms-settings: bluetooth* to open the Bluetooth settings.
    - **A custom app**: Enter the [registered URI](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/handle-uri-activation) in the format that the app expects.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If a custom app has been registered as the [default handler for a URI](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/handle-uri-activation), an author can open it by specifying a URI in the format that the app expects. Apps can be opened in [kiosk mode](/hololens/hololens-kiosk). Administrators can [use Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) and Windows PowerShell to allow or block apps on HoloLens 2 devices with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/custom-profile-hololens).

1. Select **Save**.

1. To view, edit, or delete the link, select and hold (or right-click) the **Link** button in the **Step Editor** pane, and then select the appropriate command.
