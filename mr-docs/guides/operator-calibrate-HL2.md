# Calibrate your HoloLens 2 device to use with Dynamics 365 Guides

[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] uses holograms to show you, as an operator, exactly what you must do to perform a real-world task. For example, your guide might show you how to assemble a door for a commercial aircraft. Because instructions are provided through holograms on [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], it's very important that the holograms be correctly aligned. Otherwise, you might drill a hole in the wrong place or assemble the wrong part. To make sure that holograms are correctly aligned, you must calibrate your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device. You can complete this step by using the Calibration app that comes with your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The first time that you use the device, the following system prompt should automatically appear: "Let's adjust [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] for your eyes." To begin calibration, select **Adjust**.

## Manually calibrate your HoloLens by using the Calibration app

1. Use the start gesture to open the **Start** menu. For help with gestures, see [Gestures for navigating Dynamics 365 Guides](operator-gestures.md).

2. If **Settings** isn't pinned to the **Start** menu, select the plus sign (**+**) button to view all apps.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To select something on the holographic **Start** menu, just touch it with your index finger.

3. Select **Settings**.

4. Select **System**.

5. In the side panel, select **Calibration**.

6. Select **Run Eye Calibration**.

7. Follow the on-screen instructions.
