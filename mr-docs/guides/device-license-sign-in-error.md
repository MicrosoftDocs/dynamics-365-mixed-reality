# Sign-in error when trying to sign into Guides on a shared HoloLens device

A sign-in error occurs when trying to sign into Dynamics 365 Guides from a shared HoloLens device.

## Prerequisites

- Admin permissions in Dynamics 365 Guides

## Cause 1: A shared account has not been assigned

[Create a shared account.](device-license.md)

## Cause 2: The right roles were not assigned

[Assign the **Basic User** role and a **Dynamics 365 Guides Operator** or **Dynamics 365 Guides Restricted Operator** role.](device-license#assign-an-operator-role-to-the-shared-account)
