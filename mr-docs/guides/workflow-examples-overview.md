# Overview of workflow examples for Dynamics 365 Guides

When an author creates a guide using the PC and HoloLens apps, all the data required for that guide (instruction text, images, videos, and 3D parts) is stored in the Microsoft Dataverse. Having all of the data available in the Dataverse makes it easy to access that data to create workflow integrations using Microsoft Power Automate or other Microsoft applications.

## Example workflows

To get an idea for the types of workflows that you can create with Power Automate and Dynamics 365 Guides, check out these examples:

- [Example 1: Automatically generate PC and HoloLens apps deep links to use in an Excel Link Manager](workflow-example-1.md)
- [Example 2: Create a 3D object collection and add objects to the collection](workflow-example-2.md)
- [Example 3: Collect response data for a nonlinear guide](workflow-example-3.md)
