## Do I need to update privileges for custom security roles?

Yes. If you have created custom security roles, you must update those roles to provide privileges to the Activity table (PhoneCall table). **Users won't be able to sign in to either app if you don't update custom security roles.** Users must have the following seven privileges to be able to sign in:

- prvAppendActivity
- prvAppendToActivity
- prvAssignActivity
- prvCreateActivity
- prvReadActivity
- prvShareActivity
- prvWriteActivity

## Can I share a deep link to a guide through a HoloLens chat?

## Do I need to configure any new permissions?

There are two new permissions: 

- The Location permission (optional) can be enabled if you want to store location information in the PhoneCall table.

- The Background spatial perception (movement) permission is required if you want to use the new annotations capabilities.

[Learn more about permissions required for the HoloLens app](hololens-permissions.md)

## If I'm using both Dynamics 365 Guides and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist for a while, will I be able to filter call data by app?

Yes, you can filter by subject in the Guides model-driven app. The subject value for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist calls is "Dynamics 365 Remote Assist Call".

## How do I configure roles for users who need to use calling and annotations functionality only and who are mostly using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist currently?

Thereâ€™s no built-in way to limit access in Dynamics 365 Guides to just calling functionality.

To transition a specific user to Dynamics 365 Guides 8.0, you need to do two things:

1. Assign the Dynamics 365 Guides license to that user.

2. Assign one of Dynamics 365 Guides roles.

The user will be able to sign into Dynamics 365 Guides after doing these two steps.
