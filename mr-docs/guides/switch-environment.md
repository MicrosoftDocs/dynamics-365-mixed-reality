# Switch environments in Dynamics 365 Guides

When you're logged into a tenant with multiple environments, you can easily switch environments without having to sign out and sign in. You can switch environments even if you have different access levels. If you have [access to an environment](admin-security.md), you can switch to it.

## Switch environments in the PC app

1. While logged into the PC app, select the profile button in the top-right corner.

1. Select **Switch environment** and select the environment.

## Switch environments in the HoloLens app

If your HoloLens device is in [kiosk mode](restricted-mode-signout.md), you can switch environments, but not sign out.

1. While logged into the HoloLens app, select the profile button from the **Main** menu.
