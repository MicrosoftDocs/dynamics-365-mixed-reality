# Restrict the ability to access OneDrive files in Dynamics 365 Guides

If you [have a scenario where you need to protect your company information](restricted-mode-overview.md), you can restrict the ability of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides users to access OneDrive files. Restricting the ability to access OneDrive files is also helpful in a situation where users share a service account and you want to prevent them from accessing each other's files.

## Restrict access to OneDrive files

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/users) as an admin.

1. In the left pane, select **Users** > **Active users**, and then select **Add a user**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > It's critical to create a NEW ACCOUNT to make sure that the user won't have access to the licenses required to access OneDrive files.

1. Fill out the user information, and then select **Next**.

1. Select the **Dynamics 365 Guides** and **Microsoft Teams** license check boxes.

    > The name of the Teams license may vary based on the products you have installed.

1. Clear the **Office for the Web** and **SharePoint** license check boxes, and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Review and finish** section, make sure the information is correct, and then select **Finish adding** when you're ready.

1. The last step confirms that the user was added correctly. Select **Close**.
