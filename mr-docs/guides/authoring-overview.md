# Overview of authoring a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
 
If you're ready to start creating a guide with [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)], you're in the right place! 

To create a guide, you use two applications:

- **PC application.** You start with the PC application. Use this application to create the guide, choose an anchoring method, 
add tasks and steps, write the instructions for your steps, and assign different types of assets to support those steps. 
Supporting assets include:

  - 3D parts
  - 3D objects, such as objects from the 3D toolkit (arrows and numbers, for example)
  - 2D media (images and videos)
  
- **[!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] application in Author mode.** After creating the guide with the PC application, use the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] application in Author mode to test the flow of your guide, place your holograms in the real world, add holographic tethers to show operators where to focus, and add styles to 3D objects (warning or caution, for example).
