# Enable or disable Azure Object Anchors (Preview) in a Dynamics 365 Guides environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some or all of the functionality noted in this article is available as part of a preview release. The content and the functionality are subject to change.

As of the July 2021 release of Dynamics 365 Guides, an author has the option to anchor a guide with Azure Object Anchors.   The November 2021 release allows administrators to control if Azure Object Anchors can be selected as the guide anchor type in the PC app or accessed in the Guides model-driven app.  Azure Object Anchors can be enabled or disabled for each Dynamics 365 environment.

Azure Object Anchors uses sensing and processing on HoloLens 2 to recognize a physical object and match it with a digital twin that has been imported into Dynamics 365 Guides, converted to an object anchor, and assigned to a guide. [Learn more about Azure Object Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/ynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-app-anchor-azure-object).

If you're an administrator for Dynamics 365 Guides, you can enable or disable Azure Object Anchors in a specific Dynamics 365 Guides environment. If Azure Object Anchors are disabled, any author in the environment cannot update a guide's anchor type to an **Object Anchor** and users are not able to convert a 3D file into an object anchor in the Guides model-driven app.  [Learn more about converting 3D objects to Azure Object Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-app-anchor-azure-object#convert-the-file-in-the-guides-model-driven-app)
 

## Enable or disable Object Anchors

1. Sign in to the instance by using your admin or author credentials.

    > To find the URL for the instance, select the **Analyze** tab in the PC app. The URL is shown in the **Instance URL** field at the bottom of the page. Copy this URL, and paste it into the address bar of your web browser.
