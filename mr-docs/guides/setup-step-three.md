# Dynamics 365 Guides setup, step 3: Download and install the apps (PC and HoloLens)

> [!NOTE]
> Before you complete this step of the setup process, be sure to see step 2, [Install the Dynamics 365 Guides solution](setup-step-two.md).

There are two [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] apps:

- PC authoring app

- [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app, which has an **Author** mode and an **Operate** mode

You can install both apps from [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store, as described in the next section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you can't access [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store because of company policies, contact your admin about distributing the app.

If you're an admin, and your company uses [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store for Business to distribute your apps, you can have users install the apps either from your organization's private store or from an email link that you send. See the instructions later in this topic.

## Download the PC app

1. Make sure that your computer that runs [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] 10 is running build 10.0.17134 (April 2018 update) or later.

2. On your computer, go to **Start** ![Start button](media/windows-button.png "Start button") \> **[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store** ![Store button](media/store-button.png "Store button"), and then search for "[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]."

3. In [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store, select **Get** to download and install the application.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can make sure that the PC app is automatically updated to be compatible with the latest Dynamics 365 Guides solution version by turning on the **Update apps automatically** setting in the Microsoft Store. 

4. [Learn how to open and sign in to the PC app](install-sign-in-pc-app.md).
    
## Launch the HoloLens app

Dynamics 365 Guides is pre-installed on all HoloLens 2 devices and is pinned to the **Start** menu. Use the [Start gesture](operator-gestures-HL2.md) to open the **Start** menu. [Learn how to sign in to the HoloLens app](hololens-app-install-sign-in.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If Dynamics 365 Guides isn't pinned to the **Start** menu, [learn how to install and sign in to the HoloLens app](hololens-app-install-sign-in.md). 

We recommend that you update HoloLens to newer versions when they become available. For information about how to use Windows Update for Business, see [Manage updates to HoloLens](/hololens/hololens-updates). You can also manually update your HoloLens. 

> [!TIP]
> You can make sure that the HoloLens app is automatically updated to be compatible with the latest Dynamics 365 Guides solution version by turning on the **Update apps automatically** setting in the Microsoft Store. 

## Distribute the apps through Microsoft Store for Business

1. Open [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com/store).

2. [Get the apps](/microsoft-store/acquire-apps-microsoft-store-for-business).

3. Select one of the following distribution methods:

    - [Private store](/microsoft-store/distribute-apps-from-your-private-store)

    - [Email link](/microsoft-store/assign-apps-to-employees)

    - [Mobile device management](/microsoft-store/configure-mdm-provider-microsoft-store-for-business)
