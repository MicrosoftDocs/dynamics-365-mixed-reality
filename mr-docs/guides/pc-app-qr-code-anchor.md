    ![Download QR code button](media/qr-code-download-button.PNG "Download QR code button")

4. On your computer, open the **Guides-QRCodeAnchor** file.

5. Print the last page of the document on matte stock. (Glossy materials can affect scanning.) Bubble jet printers produce a better matte finish.

6. Make sure that the printed anchor measures between 101 and 400 millimeters (mm) wide. (These figures are based on [Version 1 QR code 
recommendations](https://www.qrcode.com/en/about/version.html).)

6. Attach the QR code anchor to a physical object in the real world, and then take a picture to help the operator find it.

7. Go back to the **Anchor** wizard in the PC app, and then select **Next** two times. (You can skip step 2 of the wizard if you took a picture of the anchor placement in the 
previous step.)

8. In step 3 of the wizard, select **Import** to import the picture that you took in step 6. Then drag it to the **Import anchor placement photo** box. When you've finished, 
select **Next** to move to the next step.

## Best practices for QR codes

Keep the following points in mind when you work with QR code anchors:

- **Position**. Make sure that the anchor is always positioned flat. Do **not** distort it or place it on a curved surface. Otherwise, alignment and detection will be 
negatively affected.

- **Location**. Place the QR code anchor in a location that is easy to access, so it doesn't interfere with work and is easy to identify (for placement).

    - Ideally, anchor placement should be central to the steps that are being done.

    - Content that is placed farther away from the anchor will be subject to more position variability than content that is placed closer to it.

    - Place the anchor where operators can quickly re-scan it for realignment at any time, if required.

    - If operators must place/remove anchors before run-throughs, position variability of content will increase.

    - Ideally, the anchor should not be moved after the author places it. If a permanent placement isn't possible, consider creating a mount, so that the anchor can be placed 
    consistently in the same location/orientation each time.

    - Take a photo or video to document the anchor placement, and add it to the guide instructions. In this way, you can help increase operator confidence.

- **Orientation**. The way that you orient the anchor can have a big impact on scanning performance.

    - Position the anchor on a vertical surface to minimize light reflections, if possible.

    - Don't use reflective materials for the support surface.

    - Very reflective surfaces that are located behind the anchor, and direct exposure to sun or artificial light, can negatively affect scanning performance.

- **Scanning angle**. When you gaze at the anchor, make sure that you're facing it straight on and at the correct distance.

    - Scanning from glancing angles can cause detection failure or misalignment.

    - The ideal scanning range is from 50 to 150 centimeters (cm).

- **Contrast**. The brightness for the provided anchor is set to a 30-percent gray background. This setting provides the best adaptability for a wide variety of environments.

    - If you have trouble detecting an anchor that you provide, try to adjust the anchor's image brightness so that it matches the average environmental brightness around the 
    anchor.

# Anchor your guide by using a circular code anchor

![Video camera graphic](media/video-camera.PNG "Video camera graphic") [Watch a video about creating a circular code anchor](https://aka.ms/guidesprintedanchor)

The process of creating a circular code anchor involves four basic steps:

1. Use the **Anchor** wizard to select the circular code anchor method.

2. Print the anchor from the PDF file that the **Anchor** wizard creates.

3. Attach the anchor to a physical object in the real world.

4. Gaze at the anchor on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to anchor the guide.

## Set up a circular code anchor

You can access the **Anchor** wizard from the **Outline** page. The **Outline** page automatically appears after you create or open a guide.

1. On the **Outline** page, select **Set your anchor now**.

    ![Set your anchor now button](media/outline-page-3.PNG "Set your anchor now button")

2. On the **Choose an anchor method** page, select **Select** for the **Circular Code** anchor method.

    ![Select button for the Circular Code anchor method](media/circular-code-choose-method.PNG "Select button for the Circular Code anchor method")

3. In step 1 of the wizard, select **Download circular code** to create a PDF file that is named **Guides-CircularCodeAnchor**. This file includes the anchor that you will 
print in step 6.

    ![Download circular code button](media/circular-code-download-code.PNG "Download circular code button")

4. On your computer, in Adobe Acrobat Reader, open the **Guides-CircularCodeAnchor** file.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] supports one size of circular code anchor. To ensure the best possible alignment accuracy, it's crucial 
    that you print the anchor at the specified size. If you use Adobe Acrobat Reader, you can set the specified size to get the best printing results.

5. Select **File** \> **Print**, and then, under **Page Sizing & Handling**, select the **Actual size** option.

    ![Actual size option](media/adobe-actual-size.PNG "Actual size option")

6. Print the last page of the document on matte stock. (Glossy materials can affect scanning.) Bubble jet printers produce a better matte finish.

7. Make sure that the printed marker spacing matches the measurements that are shown in the following illustration.

    ![Circular code anchor measurements](media/circular-code-measurements.PNG "Circular code anchor measurements")

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the anchor spacing isn't within +/– 0.1 mm, in the **Print** dialog box, select the **Custom Scale** option, and then change the percentage to compensate for the 
    size discrepancy. For example, if the result is 49 mm when you print the anchor, change the scale to 100.4 percent to get 49.196 mm, which is within tolerance.

8. Attach the circular code anchor to a physical object in the real world, and then take a picture to help the operator find it.

9. Go back to the **Anchor** wizard in the PC app, and then select **Next** two times. (You can skip step 2 of the wizard if you took a picture of the location in the previous 
step.)

10. In step 3 of the wizard, select **Import** to import the picture that you took in step 8. Then drag it to the **Import anchor placement photo** box. When you've finished, 
select **Next** to move to the next step.

    ![Import button](media/circular-code-import-photo.PNG "Import button")

11. In step 4 of the wizard, if you want to change the default instructions for the operator, select **Edit Step card text**, and then enter your instructions. When you've 
finished, select **Next** to move to the next step.

    ![Edit Step card text button](media/circular-code-operator-instructions.PNG "Edit Step card text button")

12. Put on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], open your guide, and then gaze at the circular code anchor to anchor the guide.

    ![Align HoloLens](media/circular-code-align-hololens.PNG "Align HoloLens")

## Best practices for circular code anchors

Keep the following points in mind when you work with circular code anchors:

- **Material surface.** Be sure to print the anchor on matte stock, and don't laminate it. Glossy materials can negatively affect scanning because of reflected light. Also, 
make sure that the anchor is flat. An anchor that is curved or distorted can affect alignment and detection.

- **Same anchor for authoring and printing.** For the best accuracy, use the same circular code anchor for authoring and operating.

- **Size.** Make sure that your circular code anchor is the exact size that is indicated in this topic. Incorrect anchor size causes misalignment of the guide.

    - Some applications and printers might change the size of the image.

    - If the anchor is larger than indicated, [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] interprets the scale difference in distance. Therefore, the anchor is 
    identified as closer than it really is.

    - The best way to make sure that the anchor isn't resized is to print it from the PDF file, as described earlier in this topic.

- **Location.** Place the anchor in a location on the physical object that is easy to access and out of the way.

    - Ideally, the anchor placement should be central to the steps that are being performed.

    - Content placed farther away from the anchor will be less accurate.

    - Place the anchor where operators can quickly rescan to realign at any time.

    - Ideally, the anchor should not be moved after the author places it. If a permanent placement isn't possible, consider creating a mount, so that the anchor can be 
    consistently placed in the same location/orientation every time.

    - Take a photo or video to document the circular code anchor placement, and add it to the guide instructions. In this way, you can help increase operator confidence. For 
    information about how to capture a photo or video from [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], see 
    [Mixed reality capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/mixed-reality-capture).

- **Scanning angle.** Make sure you're facing the anchor straight on at the correct distance when gazing at it. 

    - Scanning from glancing angles can cause detection failure or misalignment.

    - Ideal scanning range is from 60 to 80 cm.

## How HoloLens establishes anchor position, scale, and orientation

During scanning, the forward-facing camera on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] is used to measure the horizontal and vertical distances on the anchor. 
This information is combined with the actual anchor values that are stored internally in the application (49.2 mm and 32.8 mm) to establish the anchor's precise position, scale, and orientation in space.

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] includes an additional correction method that lets users improve the alignment by manually overriding any 
offset that is generated by the variability of the acquired image and anchor size. For more information, see [Ensuring accurate placement of holograms for circular code 
anchors](known-issues-hololens-app.md#how-do-i-address-hardware-offset-in-hololens-1-devices-to-ensure-accurate-placement-of-holograms-for-circular-code-anchor-alignment).

# Anchor your guide by using a holographic anchor

![Video camera graphic](media/video-camera.PNG "Video camera graphic") [Watch a video about creating a holographic anchor](https://aka.ms/guidesdigitalanchor)

The process of creating a holographic anchor involves three basic steps:

1. Use the **Anchor** wizard to select the holographic anchor method.

2. Use the wizard to import a custom 3D model that you want to use as the anchor, and to assign the 3D model as the anchor for the guide. The 3D model can be a representation 
of a physical object or a generic 3D object. If you don't select a custom 3D model, a default holographic anchor will be used. 

3. In the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app, in **Author** mode, use gestures to align the holographic anchor to a physical object in the real world.

## Set up a holographic anchor

You can access the **Anchor** wizard from the **Outline** page. The **Outline** page automatically appears after you create or open a guide.

1. On the **Outline** page, select **Set your anchor now**.

    ![Set your anchor now button](media/outline-page-3.PNG "Set your anchor now button")

2. On the **Choose an anchor method** page, select **Select** for the **Holographic** anchor method.

    ![Select button for the Holographic anchor method](media/holographic-anchor-choose-method.PNG "Select button for the Holographic anchor method")

3. In step 1 of the wizard, select **Import**, find your custom 3D model, and then select **Open** to import it. The model is added to the **3D parts** tab in the gallery.

    ![Import button](media/holographic-anchor-import-button.PNG "Import button")

4. Drag the 3D model from the **3D parts** tab to the **Assign holographic anchor** box. The 3D model is assigned as the holographic anchor for the guide. When you've finished, 
select **Next** to move to the next step.

    ![Assign holographic anchor box](media/holographic-anchor-drag-model.PNG "Assign holographic anchor box")

5. Put on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], open the guide, and then use air tap and hold to move the holographic anchor directly over a physical 
object in your work environment. If you must rotate the object, use air tap and hold to move the blue spheres.

    ![Blue spheres](media/blue-spheres-digital-anchor.PNG "Blue spheres")

    > [!TIP]
    > On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2, you can use your hand to directly select and place a holographic anchor when you author a guide. For more 
    information, see [HoloLens 2 gestures for authoring and navigating](authoring-gestures-HL2.md).

6. Take a picture of the place where you put the holographic anchor, to help the operator find it.

7. Go back to the PC app, and then select **Next** in the wizard two times. (You can skip step 2 of the wizard if you took a photo of the location in the previous step.)

8. In step 4 of the wizard, select the **Import** button to import the photo that you took in step 6. Then drag it to the **Import photo of anchor location** box. When you've 
finished, select **Next** to move to the next step.

    ![Import photo of anchor location box](media/holographic-anchor-import-photo.PNG "Import photo of anchor location box")

9. In step 5 of the wizard, if you want to change the default instructions for the operator, select **Edit Step card text**, and then enter your instructions. When you've 
finished, select **Next** to move to the next step, and then select **Confirm**.

    ![Edit Step card text button](media/holographic-anchor-operator-instructions.PNG "Edit Step card text button")

## Best practices for holographic anchors

- **Size.** Select a holographic anchor that isn't too small or too big. 

    - Medium-size digital objects are best. Very small or very large holograms are difficult to manipulate. 

    - Shoebox size or slightly larger is ideal.

- **Placement.** Select a holographic anchor that is as close as possible to the center of the work that is being done. The farther you place digital content from the 
holographic anchor, the less accurate it becomes.

- **Shape.** Select a holographic anchor that has a non-uniform or uncommon shape. Unusual shapes are easiest to align to.

    - Avoid objects that are mirrored. This can cause 180-degree misalignment.

    - Select shapes that have clear edges and corners, to help orient your content correctly.

- **Recognizable.** Select a holographic anchor that is obvious, easily recognizable, and easy for the operator to find. Make sure that the operator can access the object 
without encountering any obstructions.

- **Alignment direction.** Always align the holographic anchor to your physical object from the same direction. In this way, you help maximize repeatability for operators.

    - Placement from different perspectives can cause misalignment.

    - Always look at the holographic anchor from multiple angles to make sure that it's aligned to the physical object.

# Change from one anchor type to another

1. On the **Outline** page, select the anchor at the top of the page, or select the **Anchor** button in the left navigation pane. The **Anchor** wizard is opened.

    ![Anchor button and anchor](media/change-anchor-method.PNG "Anchor button and anchor")

2. In the lower-left corner of the wizard window, select **Change anchor method**.

    ![Change anchor method button](media/change-anchor-method-button.PNG "Change anchor method button")

3. Select the anchor type that you want to change to.

4. In the warning message that appears, select **Switch anchor method**.

# Other factors that affect anchoring accuracy

The following factors can also affect the accuracy of the anchor and/or user perception of the alignment:

- **Interpupillary distance (IPD) setting.** IPD is the distance between the center of the user's pupils. Because different users might have different IPDs, it's crucial 
that the appropriate IPD be set, so that [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] can adapt its display. An incorrect IPD setting can cause inaccurate perception. 
It can also cause instability of holograms in space. To calibrate your IPD on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 1, [use the HoloLens Calibration 
app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/calibration).

- **Pre-scanning the environment.** [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] actively scans its environment for visible features to map its surroundings. This 
scan occurs whenever the device is turned on and a user is signed in. It occurs regardless of whether you're in the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] shell 
or running apps. [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] constantly improves the accuracy of these maps as it scans the environment from different viewpoints and 
stores the maps on the device. Holograms are placed in relation to these maps. The more accurate the map, the more accurate the hologram placement.

    Before [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] is used on a [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] that hasn't been used in a 
    particular environment, have the user put on the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], sign in to the device, and walk around the space where hologram 
    instructions have been placed or will be placed. Although the user can perform this step from the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] shell, we recommend 
    that the **Start** menu be hidden, so that the user can see the space as he or she walks around. By walking at a leisurely pace while slowly looking up and down, the user 
    will give the device an opportunity to find features and construct accurate maps. This process is called "pre-scanning," because it's done before you run 
    [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. You must complete this process only once for each environment, because 
    [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] stores the maps that it creates on the device and remembers the spaces that it has scanned.

    Very dark or very bright environments, or environments that include very reflective surfaces (mirrors), dark surfaces, or featureless surfaces, negatively affect the 
    ability of [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to recognize the space. If [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] can't correctly recognize 
    the space, hologram position and stability are affected in turn.

- **Impact of device positioning on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 1.** [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] uses a novel display 
technology to project images in the user's field of vision, creating holograms. On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 1, the way that users wear a device 
on their head has a huge impact on the perceived position of the holograms. The best way to understand this point is to adjust the device positioning while you align holograms 
to their physical counterparts in [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. Notice how the alignment of holograms is affected when you shift the device 
left and right, up and down, or forward and backward. Users should wear the device in a consistent way, and they should understand that subtle shifts in device positioning 
might not feel different but can cause significant changes in perceived hologram locations. On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2, issues with device 
positioning are addressed through eye tracking.
