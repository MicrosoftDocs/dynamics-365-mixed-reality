# Get oriented with the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app (for authors)

After you anchor your guide in the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app, you'll see the Step card page. The Step card is the hub of everything that you do with your guide. It's also what your operators see when they use the guide. The Step card follows operators around in their environment to keep the instructions where they need them as they move around their workspace.

You (and your operators) move through a guide by gazing at the **Next** and **Back** buttons. If you gaze at the **Back** button, you go to the most-recently-visited step (similar to a web browser **Back** button). You can also use gestures such as air tap to select the **Next** or **Back** button.

> [!TIP]
> When you switch between the PC app and the HoloLens app, select **Refresh** to make sure that you have the latest version of the guide.

## Step card page overview

The following illustration shows the different user interface elements for the Step card page.

Here's what each button or UI element is used for.

| Number | UI element | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ![Save button.](media/save-button.png "Save button") | Save | Save the guide. |
| 2 | ![Undo button.](media/undo-button.png "Undo button") | Undo | Undo the last change. You can undo up to 100 changes. |
| 3 | ![Redo button.](media/redo-button.png "Redo button") | Redo | Redo the last change. You can redo up to 100 changes. |
| 4 | ![Home button.](media/home-button.PNG "Home button") | Home | Select a different guide. |
| 5 | ![Follow Mode button](media/follow-button.PNG "Follow Mode button") | Follow mode | Have the Step card follow you, or lock it to a location.<p>[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] includes a feature that is called **Follow** mode. Wherever you look, the Step card follows your gaze. Therefore, you never have to worry where your instructions are. When you turn off **Follow** mode, the Step card stays where it is. You can move the Step card wherever you want at any time. Just grab it by using the navigation bar.</p> |
| 6 | ![Anchor button](media/anchor-button.PNG "Anchor button") | Anchor | Re-anchor (realign) your guide.<p>[!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] can sometimes lose tracking. To fix this issue, you must re-anchor the guide by gazing at the anchor again.</p> |
| 7 | ![Settings button.](media/settings-button.PNG "Settings button") | Settings | Access the following setting:<ul><li>**Build number**. See the build that you're using.</li></ul> |
| 8 | ![Profile button.](media/profile-button.PNG "Profile button") | Profile | Sign in and out. |
| 9 | ![Outline button.](media/outline-button.png "Outline button") | Outline | Go to the **Outline** page.<p>You can use the **Outline** page to quickly move around your guide.</p> |
| 10 | ![Step counter.](media/step-progress.PNG "Step progress") | Step counter | See what step you're on in the task. |
| 11 | ![Task name.](media/task-name-hololens-app.PNG "Task name") | Task name | The name of the task you're on. |
| 12 | ![Gem button for dragging a dotted line.](media/gem.png "Gem button for dragging a dotted line") | Gem | By dragging the gem, you can create a dotted line to draw attention to a focus area. |
| 13 | (See the green rectangular area in the illustration.) | Bin | See the 3D parts (models) that can be added for the step. 3D parts include 3D objects from the 3D toolkit and any 3D models (computer-aided design \[CAD\] drawings) that you import to mimic 3D parts in your operator's real-world environment. |

> [!TIP]
> After you're familiar with the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app, it's a good idea to go through your whole guide in **Operate** mode to see how it flows. As you step through your guide, make a note of things that you want to change in the PC app. For example, you might have to move some steps around, add tasks or steps, or add more holograms. In general, it's best to make these changes in the PC app before you start to place holograms, add dotted lines, styles, and so on.
