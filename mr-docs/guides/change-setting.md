# Change a setting in the Dynamics 365 Guides version 7.0 HoloLens app

If you're using Dynamics 365 Guides version 7.0, you can use touch to change a setting in the HoloLens app. The **Settings** screen has two settings:

- **Narration**. Turn on or off the ability to have HoloLens read instructions out loud. [Learn more about using the narrator](voice-commands.md#narration). 

- **Telemetry**. For privacy reasons, you can turn off the ability to send telemetry data to Microsoft in the HoloLens app. Microsoft uses this data to improve the product. By opting out, you prevent Microsoft from collecting any data about your activity. [Learn more about data opt out](hololens-app-data-opt-out.md).

Use can also use the **Settings** screen to access documentation and how-to videos (**Help** button), access policy and license links (**Links** button), or determine which version of the HoloLens app you're using (**About** button).

## Change a setting

1. Look at the palm of your hand to open the Main menu, and then select the **Settings** button.
