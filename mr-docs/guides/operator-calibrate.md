# Calibrate your HoloLens 1 device to use with Dynamics 365 Guides

[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] uses holograms to show you, as an operator, exactly what you must do to perform a real-world task. For example, your guide might show you how to assemble a door for a commercial aircraft. It's very important to calibrate the HoloLens display for your own eyes so that holograms are properly displayed and perceived as accurately positioned in space. Otherwise, you might drill a hole in the wrong place or assemble the wrong part. To make sure that holograms are correctly aligned, you must calibrate your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device. You can complete this step by using the Calibration app that comes with your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Dynamics 365 Guides version 502.2011.28001 (December 8, 2020 release) and later, HoloLens operating system version 10.0.17134 (Redstone 4) is no longer supported. This version of the operating system is used only on HoloLens 1. HoloLens 1 customers must upgrade to HoloLens version 10.0.17763 or later to continue to receive the latest updates. Work with your IT admin to update your HoloLens operating system. If you choose not to upgrade, you can continue to use the current version of Dynamics 365 Guides that is already installed on the device. However, HoloLens version 10.0.17763 or later is required to install Dynamics 365 Guides on any new or refactored HoloLens 1 device.
