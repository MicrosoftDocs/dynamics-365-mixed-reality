# Export and import Dynamics 365 Guides folders between environments

You can export the folders you have created in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides and import them into another environment to recreate your file structure. The guides, 3D content, and media associated with these folders aren't included in this process. However, you can use the [Content Migration Tool](migrate.md) to migrate this content after youâ€™ve imported your folders.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you export and import your folders first, and then migrate the content, the relationships between the folders and the content will be reconstructed.

## Prerequisites 

- You must be a system administrator to access the Power Platform admin center.  

- You must have Dynamics 365 Guides solution version 600.1.0.0 or later.  

We also highly recommend [backing up the contents](/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments#create-a-manual-backup) of both environments before starting the export/import process. 

## Export the folders

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/), and then sign into the environment that contains the folders you want to export.

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**.

1. [Create a new solution](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-solution) with **Default Publisher for {orgid}** for the Publisher.

1. Select the solution you just created and select **Edit**.  

1. Select **Add existing** > **More** > **Other** > **Folder** to add the folders as components of your solution.

1. Select the folders you want to include in your export, and then select **Add**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you select a folder that includes subfolders, select the parent folder and the child folder individually. However, if you select a subfolder, the parent folder is automatically added to the list that will be exported. Deactivated folders will appear on the list to be exported.

1. [Export your solution](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/export-solutions#export-from-power-apps), skipping publish your changes.

Once the export is ready, it's automatically downloaded as a .zip file.

### Import the folders

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/) and **ensure you are in the environment where you want to import the folders**. You can check this in the top right corner of the screen under **Environment**.

1. [Import the solution](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions) selecting the .zip file you just downloaded.

    When the import is complete, a notification appears stating that the solution has been successfully imported.
