## FAQ on Teams policies

### Can a policy be applied to a device or an app?

No, policies can only be applied to users or groups.

### Do one-to-one policies also apply to group calls?

Yes, one-to-one policies also apply to group calls, but meetings have their own policy.

### When are policies applied

Policies are applied when the user signs in. After making a policy change, the user will need to sign out and back in or close and open the app to apply the policy change.
