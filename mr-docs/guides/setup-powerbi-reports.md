# Set up Power BI reports

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides includes Power BI reports that you can use to analyze Guides processes. For information about how to open Guides Analytics by using the free [Power BI Desktop application](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/get-started/), see [Overview of Guides Analytics](./analytics-guide.md).

If you have a Power BI Pro license, you can share your Guides Analytics Power BI reports within your organization by publishing them to the Power BI Service. In this case, anyone in your organization who has a Power BI Pro license can access the report through the Power BI Service web interface that's accessible at <https://powerbi.microsoft.com>. To learn about Power BI cloud collaboration and sharing, and to sign up for a free trial of Power BI Pro, see [Getting Started with Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/get-started/) and [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).
