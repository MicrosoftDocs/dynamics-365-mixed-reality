# Guides model-driven app overview

When you create a guide in the PC authoring app, the content is stored in Microsoft Dataverse. The Guides model-driven app enables you to access and view guide content quickly from Microsoft Dataverse.

[!INCLUDE [azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](../includes/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

If you're an admin or an author for Dynamics 365 Guides, you can use the Guides model-driven app to do things that you can't do in the PC app or HoloLens app. For example, you can:

- [Activate, deactivate, or delete a guide](admin-deactivate-guide.md)

- [Assign ownership of a guide](admin-access-assign.md)

- [Change a thumbnail for a video associated with a step](pc-app-add-media.md#change-a-video-thumbnail)

- [Create a 3D object collection](workflow-example-2.md)

- [Create folders to organize your guides](admin-create-folders.md)

- [Create workflows in Microsoft Power Apps to automate Dynamics 365 Guides processes](workflow-examples-overview.md)

- [Fix a corrupted guide](corrupted-guide.md)

- [Opt out of storing Guides usage data](data-opt-out.md) (Admins only)

- [Share content](admin-share-guide.md)

- [View call data stored by Dynamics 365 Guides](call-logging.md)

[!INCLUDE [Model-driven app caution](../includes/model-driven-app-caution.md)]

## Limit access to the model-driven app

The Guides model-driven app is a type of app created in Microsoft Power Apps. Organizations may limit users who can access the model-driven app, but a user must be able to access the model-driven app to use the Guides HoloLens or PC app. You can limit access by sharing the app with individual users, or by sharing it with one or more Microsoft Entra groups. See [Share a model-driven app using Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app) for detailed steps on either option.
