# Create and copy a link to a guide or step in Dynamics 365 Guides

You might want to create and copy a link to a guide or a step in [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] for one or both of these reasons:

- You want to share the link with another author through email or chat.

- You want to embed the link in a QR code. In this case, when you or the operator scans the QR code from the HoloLens shell, the guide or step is automatically opened.

## Create and copy a link to a guide

1. On to the **Home** page, right-click the appropriate guide.

2. Select **Copy link to this guide**.
