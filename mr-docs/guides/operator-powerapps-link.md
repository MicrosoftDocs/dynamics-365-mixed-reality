# Open an app created in Power Apps from the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

If a Step card in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app includes a **Power Apps** button, you can open the app.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a Power Apps license.
- You must have permission to view the app that was created in Power Apps.

## Open the Power app

From the Step card, select the **Power Apps** button. The app is opened in a browser on HoloLens. When you close the browser, you return to the step.
