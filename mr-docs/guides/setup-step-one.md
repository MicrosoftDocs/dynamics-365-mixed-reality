# Dynamics 365 Guides setup, step 1: Buy a subscription

> [!NOTE]
> Before you complete this step of the setup process, be sure to see [Overview of setting up Dynamics 365 Guides](setup.md).

If you have a Microsoft work account, you can go directly to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home) to search for and buty a [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] subscription. If you can't access the Microsoft 365 admin center link, contact your Dynamics 365 administrator.

After purchasing a subscription, assign the Dynamics 365 Guides license to user accounts as described in this article.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to try out Dynamics 365 Guides before purchasing a subscription, you can [sign up for a free 60-day trial](trial-signup.md). You don't have to have administrator privileges to sign up for the 60-day trial. Dynamics 365 Guides also provides a [30-trial available for users with Dynamics 365 admin privileges](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/get-started/?appname=guides). When you sign up for this type of trial, you can create a production environment that you can continue to use after purchasing a subscription. 

## Assign the Dynamics 365 Guides license to user accounts

After you sign up for a [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] subscription, you must assign the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] license to user accounts.

1. Open the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home).
