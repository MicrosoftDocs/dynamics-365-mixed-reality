# Use SideFX Houdini to prepare 3D objects for use in Dynamics 365 Guides and mixed-reality components included in apps created with Power Apps

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions that show you how to:

- Optimize a 3D object by reducing the polygon count so that it matches [performance targets](optimize-models.md#performance-targets) for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides and mixed-reality components included in apps created with Power Apps.  

- Add the correct material to a 3D object.

- Export an optimized 3D model as a GLB file that you can use in Dynamics 365 Guides and Power Apps

- Create a template, so you can quickly optimize other 3D objects in the future.

## What is Houdini?

[Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/) is a procedural system that empowers artists to work freely, create multiple iterations, and rapidly share workflows with colleagues.

## Import a 3D object into Houdini

1. Open Houdini 17.5.

   ![Open Houdini to a new scene.](media/1-houdini-new-scene.PNG "Open Houdini to a new scene")

   A new scene is automatically created.

2. Right-click in the lower-right window pane to open the **TAB Menu** (or select the **Tab** key).

3. On the **TAB Menu**, select **Import**, and then select **File** to place a **File** node in the **Geometry** pane.

   ![Import File.](media/2-houdini-import-file.PNG "Import a file")

4. Double-click the **file1** icon (or press **I**) to drill down to the file selection part of this node. Select the **Open floating file chooser** button, and then choose the file you want to import.

   ![Screen shot of File chooser button.](media/3-houdini-file-chooser.PNG "Screen shot of File chooser button")

5. In the pop-up window, browse to the file you want to import, select it, and then select **Accept**.  

   ![Select the file.](media/4-houdini-select-file.PNG "Select the file")

   The model appears in the viewport.

## Decimate a 3D object

To reach application-specific goals, you might need to "decimate" your 3D objects. _Decimation_ is the process of recomputing the surface polygons of the model to create a similar shape with fewer polygons. This reduces visual fidelity, but increases performance. The example images below show the difference between a high-quality model used for scenes of low complexity on Microsoft HoloLens, and a low-quality model used for scenes of high complexity.

![Decimation example.](media/6-houdini-decimation-overview.PNG "Decimation example")

**To decimate a 3D object**

1.	In the **Geometry** pane on the lower right, press the **Tab** key to open the **TAB Menu**.

2. Select **Polygon** > **PolyReduce**, and then press **Enter** to select the **PolyReduce** node. Select or click in the area beneath the **File** node to place a **PolyReduce** node.

    ![Polygon PolyReduce.](media/7-houdini-poly-reduce.PNG "Polygon PolyReduce")

   A new node named **polyreduce1** appears in the **Geometry** pane near the imported geometry node.

    ![Polyreduce node.](media/8-houdini-polyreduce1-node.PNG "Polyreduce node")

3.	Select the bottom gray dot on the node of the imported geometry, and then drag a connection line to the leftmost top dot on the **polyreduce1** node. A red arrow appears on the dot on the **polyreduce1** node.

    ![Drag to create a connection.](media/9-houdini-drag-geometry.PNG "Drag to create a connection")

5. Select the center of the **polyreduce1** node, and look at the options available in the tab above the **Geometry** pane.

    ![PolyReduce options.](media/10-houdini-polyreduce1-options.PNG "PolyReduce options") 

6.	Next to **Target**, select **Output Polygon Count**. This enables you to specify a polygon count that meets the polygon targets you want.

    ![Output Polygon Count.](media/11-houdini-output-polygon-count.PNG "Output Polygon Count")

7.	To see the results, select the **polyreduce1** node, and then select the **Template** (pink) and **Display** (blue) bars on the right side of the node.

    The model changes to show much less detail.

    ![PolyReduce results.](media/12-houdini-polyreduce-results.PNG "PolyReduce results")

    There is some room to experiment with the polygon counts for use on mixed-reality devices. You can use the **Number To Keep** slider to fine-tune the look of the model. Experiment with this slider to get the look you like with the polygon count you need.

## Add a material with a principled shader

To give the model a more realistic appearance, you can add a shader to the model to define how shiny and smooth the model appears.

1.	Open the **Material Palette** tab (in the same window pane as the node system), select **Principled Shader**, and then drag it to the open space in the pane to the right.

    ![Principled Shader.](media/13-houdini-shader.PNG "Principled Shader")

2.	Right-click **Principled Shader**, and then select **Assign to Selected Objects or Geometry**.

    ![Assign to Selected Objects or Geometry.](media/14-houdini-assign-to-selected-objects.PNG "Assign to Selected Objects or Geometry")

3.	Highlight the entire model. To do this, select the window, and then select **Assign**.

    ![Highlighted model.](media/15-houdini-highlight-model.PNG "Highlighted model")

4.	In the **Geometry** pane, you'll see that a **material1** node has been created and linked below the **polyreduce1** node.

    ![Material node.](media/16-houdini-material-node.PNG "Material node")
  
5.	Select the open **Open floating file chooser** button in the upper pane, select **principledshader**, and then select **Accept**.

    ![Accept principledshader.](media/17-houdini-accept.PNG "Accept principledshader")

### Adjust material properties

You can adjust visible properties like the color of the material in the window pane above the **Material Palette** when you have the **Principled Shader** highlighted. For example, start with **Roughness** at **0.8** and **Metallic** at **0.2** for CAD objects.

![Adjust materials.](media/18-houdini-adjust-materials.PNG "Adjust materials")

**To change the color of the 3D object**

1. Select the color swatch button located to the right of **Base Color**.

    ![Base Color.](media/18.1-houdini-select-color-swatch.png "Base Color")

2. In the **Color Editor** dialog box, pick a color. You can pick from previous colors, the mixer wheel, or from the sliders.

    ![Color Editor.](media/19-houdini-color-editor.PNG "Color Editor")

3. When you're satisfied with the colors, close the **Color Editor** dialog box.

## Export the model to a GLB file

You need to export the model to a GLB file to use it with Dynamics 365 Guides and Power Apps.

1.	In the **Geometry** pane, press the **Tab** key to open the **TAB Menu**.

2. Select **Export** > **ROP GLTF Output**, press the **Enter** key, and then select below the **material1** node to place the **rop_gltf1** node.

    ![Export ROP GLTF Output.](media/20-houdini-export-rop-gltf.PNG "Export ROP GLTF Output")

3.	Drag a connection from the **material1** node to the **rop_gltf1** node.

    ![Connection from material1 node to rop_gltf1 node.](media/21-houdini-rop-connection.PNG "Connection from material1 node to rop_gltf1 node")
  
4.	In the top pane, in the **Export Type** field, select **glb**.

    ![Export to GLB file.](media/21-houdini-export-glb.PNG "Export to GLB file")

5.	Next to the **Output File** field, select the **File Chooser** button, and then choose a name and destination for the GLB file.  Make sure to add **.glb** to the end of the file name.

    ![File chooser button.](media/23-houdini-file-chooser.PNG "File chooser button")

6.	Select **Render to Disk** to finish the export and create the GLB file.

    ![Screen shot of Render to Disk button.](media/24-houdini-render-to-disk.PNG "Screen shot of Render to Disk button")

## Create a template

Now that the node tree is set up, you can use it as a template to quickly prepare 3D objects.

The first thing you need to do is replace whatever geometry is currently being used with a default geometry. This makes the template file lightweight so that it loads quickly when you open it.

1.	Select the file icon to activate the geometry file menu in the upper pane.

2.	Change the **Geometry File** field to **default.bgeo**, and then select **Reload Geometry**.

    ![Template.](media/25-houdini-template.PNG "Template")

    This refreshes the geometry so that it's a generic cube.

3.	Change the file name to something generic like **Template**.

4.	On the **File** menu, select **Save**, and then save the file as something memorable like **Prep_Template**.  

    ![File Save.](media/26-houdini-file-save.PNG "File Save")

The template is ready. Close Houdini to try it out.

### Use a template

1.	Launch Houdini, open the template file by selecting **File** > **Open**, and then select the template.

    ![File Open template.](media/27-houdini-open-template.PNG "File Open template")

2.	Select the center of the geometry file node to switch to the **File** context menu, and then select the **Open floating file chooser** button to select the 3D object you want to prepare.  

    ![Screen shot of Open floating file chooser button.](media/28-houdini-file-chooser2.PNG "Screen shot of open floating file chooser button")

3.	When the geometry is loaded, select the red sphere on the **polyreduce1** node, and then the blue tab to the far right of the **polyreduce1** node.

    ![Select red sphere.](media/29-houdini-reduction-tools.PNG "Select red sphere")

    This shows you what the reduced poly model looks like in the view window, and provides access to the reduction tools.

4.	When the model reaches a quality that meets your requirements, select the **rop_gltf1** node, select the **Open floating file chooser** button, and then choose a location and name for the file you're exporting. Be sure to include the .glb extension in the file name.

    ![Export rop-gltf.](media/30-houdini-rop-gltf.PNG "Export rop-gltf")

5.	Select **Render to Disk** to create the 3D object.

    ![Render to Disk button.](media/31-houdini-render-to-disk-2.PNG "Render to Disk button")

Repeat this process with the rest of your 3D objects to rapidly produce optimized objects ready for use in Dynamics 365 Guides and Power Apps.
