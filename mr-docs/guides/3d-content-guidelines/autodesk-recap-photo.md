# Use Autodesk ReCap Photo to create 3D objects for Dynamics 365 Guides or for mixed-reality components included in apps created with Power Apps

This tutorial guides you through the process of using Autodesk ReCap Photo photogrammetry software to create 3D objects that can be used with Microsoft Dynamics Guides and for mixed-reality components included in apps created with Microsoft Power Apps.

This tutorial is created only for informational purposes, to show how ReCap Photo works with Dynamics 365 Guides and Power Apps. Microsoft Corporation isn't affiliated with, isn't a partner of, and doesn't endorse or sponsor Autodesk or any of its products.

## What is Autodesk ReCap Photo?

Autodesk ReCap Photo processes photographs that are taken from drones to create 3D representations of current conditions of sites, objects, and more. [Learn more about Autodesk ReCap Photo](https://www.autodesk.com/products/recap/overview).

## Installing Autodesk ReCap Photo

You can [sign up for a free trial](https://aka.ms/autodesk_recap_photo_overview) of Autodesk ReCap Photo.

## Photography tips

The following tips will help you take quality photos for photogrammetry:

- If you can, take photos in a location where lighting is consistent and doesn't cast shadows.

- Try to keep your own shadow out of the picture.

- Make sure that there are no moving objects in the background when you take the photos.

- If the camera that you're using has a high dynamic range (HDR) setting, turn the feature off, and try not to adjust the exposure of your photographs while you capture images.

- Take pictures about one meter apart while you circle the object.

- If you can, maintain a perpendicular location relative to the object while you take photos.

- If the object is large, move in a lateral motion from one end of the object to the other. Change the height at each pass until you've captured all surfaces.

## Start a new project

1. Open Autodesk ReCap Photo. When you first open Autodesk ReCap Photo, you'll see the dashboard.

    > [!NOTE]
    > On the dashboard, you can select either **Aerial** or **Object** to create a new 3D project. This tutorial covers the **Object** workflow.

2. Under **Create 3D**, select **Object**.

    ![Object option.](media/recap-photo1.PNG "Object option")

3. Click anywhere on the page that appears, according to the prompt, and then add the photos that you want to use to create your 3D object. After you've finished importing the photos, select **Create**.

    ![Create button.](media/recap-photo2.PNG "Create button")

4. On the **Create Project** page, enter a name for your project, and then select **Start** to process your photos. Processing can take some time, depending on the number of photos that you added and the speed of your internet connection.

    ![Create Project page.](media/recap-photo3.PNG "Create Project page")

    > [!NOTE]
    > At this point, you can use the **Autocrop** feature if you want. This tutorial shows how to crop the 3D object later in the process.

5. After your 3D object has been processed, it appears in the **My Cloud Drive** section of the dashboard. Select the **Download this project from the cloud** (down arrow) button to download your 3D object.

    ![Download this project from the cloud button.](media/recap-photo4.PNG "Download this project from the cloud button")

6. Select a location to save your model to, and then select **Select Folder**.

    ![Select folder to extract mesh to dialog box with Select Folder button selected.](media/recap-photo5.PNG "Select folder to extract mesh to dialog box with Select Folder button selected")

7. You'll see a new 3D object that has the name that you entered. Select the model to open it in the editor.

    ![New model.](media/recap-photo6.PNG "New model")

    Your 3D object is loaded on the editor page.

    ![Model loaded on the editor page.](media/recap-photo7.PNG "Model loaded on the editor page")

## Edit the 3D object

Several tools are available on the left side and at the bottom of the editor page. You can use these tools to clean up your 3D object. Experiment with these tools to clean up the parts of your 3D object that you don't want to keep. This tutorial shows how to remove the floor from the model.

1. At the bottom of the editor page, select the **Lasso/Fence** tool.

    ![Lasso/Fence tool.](media/recap-photo8.PNG "Lasso/Fence tool")

2. Use the **Lasso/Fence** tool to select everything except the object that you want to keep.

    ![Floor selected.](media/recap-photo9.PNG "Floor selected")

3. Press **Enter**, and then press **Delete**. You might have to repeat these steps a few times to remove most of the floor.

4. Select the **Slice** tool to remove the rest of the floor. This tool creates a slicing plane that you can use to cut away geometry below a specific point. The following settings are available in the **Slice** dialog box:

    - **Fill**: Select this option to close the model, based on the boundary of the open area of the model. In some cases, filling might not be easy.

    - **No fill**: Select this option to leave the model as an open model.

    - **Transform plane**: Select this check box to align the plane so that the floor isn't visible.

    ![Slicing tool settings.](media/recap-photo10.PNG "Slicing tool settings")

5. When the model looks the way that you want it to, select **Apply**.

The rest of the floor is removed from your 3D object and the mesh on the bottom is filled.

## Decimate the 3D object to help increase performance

After you've finished removing the parts of the mesh that you don't want to keep, you can decimate it to a polygon count that meets the [performance targets for Dynamics 365 Guides and Power Apps](optimize-models.md#performance-targets).

1. On the left side of the editor page, select the **Decimate mesh** tool.

    ![Decimate mesh tool.](media/recap-photo11.PNG "Decimate mesh tool")

2. In the **Decimate** dialog box, in the **Target face count** field, specify a polygon count that balances visual fidelity with performance requirements.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Unless precise geometry is very important, don't select the **Best geometry** check box, because it will remove your textures. The textures that are produced through photogrammetry add significant detail to the 3D object.

    ![Decimate settings.](media/recap-photo12.PNG "Decimate settings")

3. Select **Decimate all**.

The 3D object is optimized and ready for export.

## Export the 3D object as an OBJ file

Before you can use the 3D object in Dynamics 365 Guides or Power Apps, it must be in the GLB file format. In this step, you'll export the model as an OBJ file that can then be converted to a GLB file.

1. On the left side of the editor page, select the **Export** button, and then select the **Export model** button to open the export settings.

    ![Export model button.](media/recap-photo14.PNG "Export model button")

2. In the **Export model** dialog box, in the **Export as** field, select **OBJ** as the export file type, and then, in the **Size** field, select **4096x4096** as the texture size. When you've finished, select **Export**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Although you can select a larger or smaller texture size, be aware that the size will affect either performance or visual fidelity. 

    ![Export model settings.](media/recap-photo15.PNG "Export model settings")

3. Select a location to save your file to, and then select **Select Folder**.

    ![Select Folder button.](media/recap-photo16.PNG "Select Folder button")

The 3D object is exported to the folder that you selected.

## Use Blender to convert the OBJ file to a GLB file

There are several applications that you can use to convert an OBJ file to a GLB file. This tutorial shows how to use Blender.

### What is Blender?

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a free, open-source 3D creation suite. It supports the whole 3D pipeline: modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, and video editing and game creation.

If you use Blender to prepare your 3D objects, review the information on the Blender website, and [download the latest version for Windows](https://www.blender.org/download/).

### Import your 3D object into Blender

1. Open Blender. A new scene is automatically created.
2. Right-click the cube, and then select **Delete** to delete it.

    ![Delete command.](media/recap-photo17.PNG "Delete command")

2. On the **File** menu, select **Import** \> **Wavefront (.obj)** to import the OBJ file.

    ![Wavefront (.obj) command.](media/recap-photo18.PNG "Wavefront (.obj) command")

3. Under **Import OBJ**, follow these steps:

    1. Clear the **Object** and **Group** check boxes, and select the **Image Search** check box.

        ![Import OBJ settings.](media/recap-photo19.PNG "Import OBJ settings")

    2. Select **Import OBJ**. Blender imports the 3D object as a single item and searches the subfolder for any materials.

        ![Import OBJ button.](media/recap-photo20.PNG "Import OBJ button")

### Export the 3D object as a GLB file

The last step is to export the model as a GLB file so that it can be used with Dynamics 365 Guides or Power Apps.

1. In Blender, on the **File** menu, select **Export** \> **glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf)**.

    ![glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf) command.](media/recap-photo21.PNG "glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf) command")

2. Under **Export glTF 2.0**, in the **Format** field, select **glTF Binary (.glb)**, and then select the **Selected Objects** check box.

    ![Export glTF 2.0 settings.](media/recap-photo22.PNG "Export glTF 2.0 settings")

3. Enter a name for your file.

    ![File named.](media/recap-photo23.PNG "File named")

4. Select **Export glTF 2.0**.

    ![Export glTF 2.0 button.](media/recap-photo24.PNG "Export glTF 2.0 button")
