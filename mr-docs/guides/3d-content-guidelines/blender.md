# Use Blender to prepare 3D objects for use in Dynamics 365 Guides and in mixed-reality components included in apps created with Power Apps

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions that show you how to:

- Reduce the polygon count of a 3D model so that it matches the performance needs specific to [performance targets](optimize-models.md#performance-targets) for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides and for mixed-reality components included in apps created with Microsoft Power Apps.

- Combine the 3D model's multiple materials (colors) into a single texture that can be applied to the model.

- Export the optimized 3D model as a [GLB file](index.md#gltf-and-glb-file-formats) that can be used in Dynamics 365 Guides and Power Apps.

The combination of reducing polygons and turning multiple materials into a single texture can transform a complex and resource-intensive 3D model into a 3D model that performs well in Dynamics 365 Guides and Power Apps.

## What is Blender?

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a free, open-source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline: modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, and video editing and game creation.

If Blender is the software that you decide to use to prepare your 3D objects, review Blender's website and [download the most current stable version for Windows](https://www.blender.org/download/).

## Overall steps for preparing a 3D model with Blender

Preparing a 3D model for mixed reality with Blender includes the following steps:

1.	Import the model into Blender.

2.	Decimate the model.

3.	Unwrap the model (UV unwrapping).

4.	Assign materials.

5.	Bake the textures.

6.	Export the model as a GLB file.

## Import the model into Blender

1.	Open Blender. When you open the app, a new scene is automatically created.

2.	Right-click the cube, and then select **Delete** to delete it.

    ![Delete cube.](media/blender-delete-cube.png "Delete cube")

3.	Select **File** > **Import** > **Wavefront (.obj)** to import the OBJ file.

    ![File import.](media/blender-clear-check-boxes.png "File import")

4.	Under **Import OBJ**, do the following:

    a. Clear the **Object** and **Group** check boxes, and select the **Image Search** check box.

    ![Image search.](media/blender-import-obj.PNG "Image search")

    b. Select **Import OBJ** on the right side of the screen. This imports the 3D model as one item, and searches in the subfolder for any materials.

    ![Import object.](media/blender-import-obj-2.png "Import object")

    When you select **Import OBJ**, you'll see the 3D model with the imported materials.

      > [!TIP]
      > If the 3D model is extremely large or small, or hard to see, or is possibly off-screen as shown in the following graphic, you can use the mouse wheel to zoom the camera in or out until the model is visible.

      ![Zoom camera.](media/blender-zoom-camera.png "Zoom camera")

      If the 3D model appears gray, select the **Look Dev** shading option to show the colors.

      ![Look Dev shading option full screen.](media/blender-look-dev-full-screen.png "Look Dev shading option full screen")

      c. Review the **Tris** count (number of polygons) at the bottom right of the screen.

      ![Tris count.](media/blender-tris-count.PNG "Tris count")

      If this number meets the [performance target resolution](optimize-models.md#performance-targets), you can skip the decimation step and go directly to [Unwrap the model](#unwrap-the-model) later in this tutorial. If it doesn't meet the target resolution, continue to the next section to decimate the model.

## Decimate the model

To reach application-specific performance goals, you might need to "decimate" the model. _Decimation_ is the process of recomputing the surface polygons of the model to create a similar shape with fewer polygons. This reduces visual fidelity, but increases performance. The example images below show a high-fidelity model that can be used when you're viewing one or two 3D objects at a time on Microsoft HoloLens, and a low-quality 3D model used when you're viewing ten or more objects at a time on HoloLens.

![Decimation examples.](media/blender-decimation-examples.PNG "Decimation examples")

1.	Select the model, and then go to the **Modifiers** menu ![Modifiers menu.](media/blender-wrench.png "Modifiers menu") in the tool column on the right.

2.	On the **Modifiers** menu, in the **Add Modifier** list, select **Decimate**.

    ![Decimate.](media/blender-add-modifier-decimate.PNG "Decimate")

3.	With the model selected, change the **Ratio** value to a number between 0.0 and 1.0. This setting determines the percentage of polygons (triangles) that are removed. For example, a value of 0.5 reduces the original polygon count to 50%. You'll see the **Tris** value in the bottom right of the Blender window decrease as you change the ratio. When the number reaches a value that matches your performance goal and looks good, select **Apply**.

## Unwrap the model (UV unwrapping)

You can skip this step if your model has only one color.

To visualize the concept of UV unwrapping, imagine cutting out every surface of a 3D model and placing those surfaces flat on a piece of paper. The U and V dimensions represent the vertical and horizontal axes of the piece of paper in the same way that X, Y, and Z represent the three-dimensional axes of a 3D model. Unwrapping the UVs enables you to paint the flattened pieces with the material colors of the model. This painted paper is called a *texture*, and it's later wrapped back on top of the model, giving it the illusion of being made from different-colored pieces when it's actually one item with a colorful texture wrapped around it. This process is called *texture baking*, which is covered later in this tutorial.

1.	Select the model, hover over the main menu, press the **Tab** key to enter **Edit Mode**, press **a** to select all, and then on the **UV** menu, select **Smart UV Project**.

    ![Smart UV Project.](media/blender-UV.png "Smart UV Project")

    > [!TIP]
    > Enter **Edit Mode** by selecting the **Edit Mode** list in the upper-left corner, or press the **Tab** key. Pressing the Tab key while already in **Edit Mode** returns you to **Object Mode**, as shown in the following graphic.

    ![Blender Object mode.](media/blender-object-mode.PNG "Blender Object mode")

2.	Keep the default settings for the properties, and then select **OK**.

    ![Default settings.](media/blender-default-settings.PNG "Default settings")

3.	Make sure that you're in **Edit Mode** (press the **Tab** key), and that the entire model is still selected (press **a**). When the entire model is selected, it's orange.

4.	Select the **UV Editor** menu (or press **Shift+F10**).
  
    ![UV Editor.](media/blender-uv-editor.PNG "UV Editor")

5.	On the **UV** menu, select **Pack Islands**.

    ![Pack Islands.](media/blender-pack-islands.PNG "Pack Islands")

    The outlined pieces are reorganized to represent the surface of the model as efficiently as possible. After packing the islands, the UVs look like this:

    ![Results of Pack Islands.](media/blender-pack-islands-after.PNG "Results of Pack Islands")

6.	Create a copy of the mesh to bake the texture onto. To do this:

    a. Select the model.

    b. Right-click the model to open the menu.

    c. Select **Duplicate Objects**.

    d. Press **Spacebar**.

    ![Duplicate Objects.](media/blender-duplicate-object.png "Duplicate Objects")

## Prepare materials for texture baking

1. Select the duplicate model, and then select the **Materials** tab ![Materials tab.](media/blender-materials-tab.PNG "Materials tab") to go the **Materials** panel.

   ![Screen shot with Materials tab selected.](media/blender-materials-tab-full-screen.PNG "Screen shot with Materials tab selected")

2. Delete all the materials for the duplicate 3D model by selecting the minus sign to the right of the materials.

   ![Minus sign.](media/blender-minus-sign-full-screen.PNG "Minus sign")

3. To hide the original 3D model and show just the duplicate, select the "eye" to the right of the original 3D model name. Notice that there are no materials on the duplicate 3D model.

    ![Select eye.](media/blender-select-eye.PNG "Select eye")

4. Select the plus sign in the **Materials** panel to add a new material to the duplicate.

    ![Plus sign.](media/blender-plus-sign.PNG "Plus sign")

5. Select **New** to add a new material to the material slot.

    ![New.](media/blender-new.PNG "New")

6. Hover over the viewport (the main window where the 3D model is shown), press the **Tab** key to enter **Edit Mode**, press **a** to select all, and then select **Assign** from the **Materials** tab ![Screen shot showing Materials tab.](media/blender-materials-tab.PNG "Screen shot showing Materials tab").

    ![Assign.](media/blender-assign.PNG "Assign")

7.	Select the icon to the left of **Object Mode**, and then select **Image Editor**.

    ![Image Editor.](media/blender-image-editor.png "Image Editor")

8.	Create a new image (select **Add** > **Image** > **New**).

    ![Add new image.](media/blender-add-new-image.PNG "Add new image")

9. Save the new image as **My_Texture** or a similar name that's easy to remember, and then set the width and height to 1024 &times; 1024 pixels. Keep the default values for the other options.

    ![Save as My_Texture.](media/blender-my-texture.PNG "Save as My_Texture")

10.	Select the icon to the left of **View**, and then select the **Shader Editor**.

    ![Shader Editor.](media/blender-shader-editor-full-screen.PNG "Shader Editor")

11.	With the duplicate 3D model selected, select **Add** > **Texture** > **Image Texture**. Select or click to place the image texture node in the window.

    ![Image Texture.](media/blender-image-texture.PNG "Image Texture")

12.	Drag the yellow node link (the yellow dot) labeled **Color** in the image texture window to the **Base Color** yellow node on the **Principled BSDF** node, to connect them.

    ![Principled BSDF.](media/blender-principled-bsdf.PNG "Principled BSDF")

13.	In the drop-down menu on the image texture node, find the texture you just created and select it.

    ![Created texture.](media/blender-image-texture-2.PNG "Created texture")

14.	Select **3D Viewport** at the upper left to go to the **3D Viewport** menu.

    ![3D Viewport.](media/blender-3D-viewport.PNG "3D Viewport")

## Bake the materials onto the texture

After the texture and material are set up on the duplicate 3D model, it's time to bake the materials from the original 3D model onto that texture. The texture will be wrapped around the duplicate 3D model, which makes it higher performing while using the original colors.

1.	Select the **Render** tab ![Render tab.](media/blender-render-tab.png "Render tab")

2.  Select **Cycles** as the render engine.

3.	In the **Bake** menu, set **Bake Type** to **Diffuse**.

4.	Clear the **Direct** and **Indirect** check boxes.

5.	Select the original 3D model, and then hold **Shift** while selecting the duplicate 3D model.

6.	Select the **Selected to Active** check box.

7.	Add a **Ray Distance** value. Start with **.01**, and then increase it if the result is missing patches of color.

8.	Select **Bake**.

    ![Bake.](media/blender-bake.PNG "Bake")

    The duplicate 3D model now has the same coloring as the original, but with only one material instead of several. This can significantly reduce draw calls and increase performance.  

    To confirm that the bake was successful, you can select the eye icon ![Eye icon.](media/blender-eye-icon.PNG "Eye icon") next to the original model to hide it. Now only the duplicate with one material and texture is visible.

    ![Screen shot of Eye icon.](media/blender-eye-icon-full-screen.PNG "Screen shot of Eye icon")

## Export the model to a GLB file

The last step is to export the model to a GLB file so it can be used with Dynamics 365 Guides and Power Apps.

1.	In Blender, select **File** > **Export** > **glTF 2.0**.

    ![Export.](media/blender-export.PNG "Export")

2. On the **Export** menu, make sure that the GLB format is selected and that the **Selected Objects** check box is selected. Name your file, and then select **glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf)**.

    ![Export settings.](media/blender-gltf.png "Export settings")
