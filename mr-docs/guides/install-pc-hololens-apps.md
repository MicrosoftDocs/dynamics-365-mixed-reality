# Download and install the Dynamics 365 Guides apps (PC and HoloLens)

After your admin [installs the Dynamics 365 Guides solution](install-guides.md) and assigns licenses, set up the Guides PC authoring app and the HoloLens app. The HoloLens app has an **Author** mode and an **Operate** mode.

If you can't access Microsoft Store because of company policies, contact your admin about distributing the app. If you're an admin, and your company uses [Microsoft Store for Business to distribute your apps](#distribute-the-apps-through-microsoft-store-for-business), you can have users install the apps either from your organization's private store or from an email link that you send.

## Prerequisites

- Your computer meets the [device requirements](requirements.md#device-requirements)

## Download the PC app

1. On your computer, access [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N038FB42KKB?hl=en-us&gl=US).

1. Select **Install** to download and install the Guidesapplication.

    > [!TIP]

We recommend that you update HoloLens to newer versions when they become available. For information about how to use Windows Update for Business, see [Manage updates to HoloLens](/hololens/hololens-updates). You can also manually update your HoloLens.
