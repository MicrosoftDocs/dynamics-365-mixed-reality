# Download and install the Dynamics 365 Guides apps (PC and HoloLens)

After your admin [installs the Dynamics 365 Guides solution](install-guides.md) and assigns licenses, set up the Guides PC authoring app and the HoloLens app. The HoloLens app has an **Author** mode and an **Operate** mode.

## Prerequisites

- Your computer meets the [device requirements](requirements.md#device-requirements)

## Download the PC app

1. On your computer, access [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N038FB42KKB?hl=en-us&gl=US).

1. Select **Install** to download and install the Guides application.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can make sure that the PC app is automatically updated to be compatible with the latest Dynamics 365 Guides solution version by turning on the **Update apps automatically** setting in the Microsoft Store.

1. [Open and sign in to the PC app](install-sign-in-pc-app.md).

## Launch the HoloLens app

Dynamics 365 Guides is pre-installed on all HoloLens 2 devices and is pinned to the **Start** menu. Use the [Start gesture](operator-gestures-HL2.md) to open the **Start** menu. [Learn how to sign in to the HoloLens app](hololens-app-install-sign-in.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If Dynamics 365 Guides isn't pinned to the **Start** menu, [learn how to install and sign in to the HoloLens app](hololens-app-install-sign-in.md).

We recommend that you update HoloLens to newer versions when they become available. For information about how to use Windows Update for Business, see [Manage updates to HoloLens](/hololens/hololens-updates). You can also manually update your HoloLens.
