# Compatibility between Dynamics 365 Guides solutions and apps (PC and HoloLens)

We recommend that you always update the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides solution at every release, so that you have access to the latest features and updates. However, if you suspect that you have an older solution version, and must verify that it's compatible with the PC and HoloLens apps that you're using, see the table that follows.

To find the app and solution versions that you're using, in the PC app, select the **About** command. You must be signed in to see both version numbers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HoloLens (1st gen) has entered Long Term Servicing State and is no longer supported on the latest versions of Dynamics 365 Guides. Customers on HoloLens (1st gen) can continue using the last supported app version (600.2103.19001) released on April 1, 2021. This version of the app is compatible with all 500 solution versions up to and including 600.0.0.1, also released on April 1, 2021. To continue using HoloLens (1st gen), existing customers should not upgrade to a solution version later than 600.0.0.1. Solution version 600.0.0.1 is no longer available for download for new HoloLens 1 customers.
