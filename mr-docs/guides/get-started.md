# Get started with Dynamics 365 Guides

Dynamics 365 Guides includes two applications, which enable authors and operators to use the right device for the right task in their workflows:

- **PC authoring app.** Authors use the PC app to add content and to create and structure their guide. These tasks are fast and efficient on a PC.

- **HoloLens app.** This app includes modes for authoring and operating.

  - **Authors** use the HoloLens app to anchor their guides and place holograms where they belong in the real world.

  - **Operators** use the HoloLens app to access the step-by-step holographic work instructions. Operators never need to use the PC app.

If you plan to author guides, you'll need to use both apps. If not, you'll only need the HoloLens app.

To get started, select the learning path below that suits you best.
