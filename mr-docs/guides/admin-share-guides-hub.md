# Share the Guides model-driven app with other users

When you create a guide in the PC authoring app, the content is stored in Microsoft Dataverse. The Guides model-driven app enables you to access and view guide content quickly from Microsoft Dataverse. [Learn more: Guides model-driven app overview](model-driven-app-overview.md).

Because the Guides model-driven app is created in Microsoft Power Apps, use [Power Apps to share it](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app). You can share the app with individual users or one or more Microsoft Entra groups. You can also limit access to the app. However, a user must be able to access the model-driven app to use the Guides HoloLens or PC app.

> [!CAUTION]
> The Guides model-driven app isn't intended as a replacement for authoring in the PC and HoloLens apps. If you use the model-driven app to create, update, or delete records, you might make Dynamics 365 Guides nonfunctional or prevent users from using the PC or HoloLens apps in the intended way. Currently, guide modification through the model-driven app isn't fully supported unless specifically covered in the Dynamics 365 Guides documentation and should be reserved for experienced Dynamics 365 users who are familiar with Microsoft Dataverse.
