# Share the Guides model-driven app to provide access

When you create a guide in the PC authoring app, the content is stored in Microsoft Dataverse. The Guides model-driven app enables you to access and view guide content quickly from Microsoft Dataverse. You can also make modifications through the Guides model-driven app. For example, you can [deactivate a guide](admin-deactivate-guide.md), [share content](admin-access-teams.md), or [create a 3D object collection](workflow-example-2.md). 

[Learn how to open the model-driven app](open-model-driven-app.md).

> [!CAUTION] 
> The Guides model-driven app isn't intended as a replacement for authoring in the PC and HoloLens apps. If you use the model-driven app to create, update, or delete records, you might make Dynamics 365 Guides nonfunctional or prevent users from using the PC or HoloLens apps in the intended way. Currently, guide modification through the model-driven app isn't fully supported unless specifically covered in the Dynamics 365 Guides documentation and should be reserved for experienced Dynamics 365 users who are familiar with Microsoft Dataverse.

## Limit access to the model-driven app

The Guides model-driven app is a type of app created in Microsoft Power Apps. It's common for organizations to limit users who can access the model-driven app. You can do this by sharing the app with individual users, or by sharing it with one or more Azure Active Directory Groups. See [Share a model-driven app using Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app) for detailed steps on either option.
