# Glossary of terms for Dynamics 365 Guides

When you're working with [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], you might find this glossary of terms helpful.

## Step
A short, discrete work item that an operator does to complete a task. Tasks are made up of steps. Steps are also the central navigation point in a guide.

## Step card
The fundamental building block in [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. You first add text and supporting assets to a Step card in the PC Authoring application. You then place holograms that are associated with each step in a real-world environment in [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] Author mode. The operator works through each step to complete a task or series of tasks. For more information about Step cards, see [PC app Step Editor overview](pc-app-step-editor-overview.md).

## Style
Visual properties that you can add to any 3D object to reinforce what you want the operator to do or know. Examples of styles include Pick up, Place, and Caution.

## Submenu
The submenu (attached to the activity card) that enables a user to filter the view of their activity content (**All** or **Recent**). 

## Task
A piece of work to be done or undertaken. A task is made up of steps that the operator must follow to complete the task.
