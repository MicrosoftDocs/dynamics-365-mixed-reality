# The solution installation or update fails repeatedly

When trying to install the Guides solution or update the solution, the message "Installation failed" displays.

To update the solution, you must have the [System Administrator](/power-platform/admin/database-security) role AND you must have a [Power Apps license](/power-platform/admin/signup-question-and-answer) (or a license like a [Dynamics 365 Guides license](setup-step-one.md) that includes a Power Apps license).

When you have a Power Apps license, the Access Mode security property is set to Read-Write, which is required for updating the solution.
