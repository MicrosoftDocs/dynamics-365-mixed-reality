# Calibrate your HoloLens 2 for authoring in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

To make sure that holograms appear in the correct locations for guides you author in Dynamics 365 Guides, you must set the interpupillary distance (IPD) for your HoloLens. You can set your IPD by using the Calibration app included with HoloLens. This step must be completed for every HoloLens user, whether you're an author or operator. In an industrial setting where holograms are used to direct operators to perform operational tasks, it's crucial that holograms are correctly aligned. Incorrect alignment can cause operator confusion and costly damage. 

If you don't configure the IPD for each user:

- Holograms will be out of alignment by 1 to 2 cm.

- Holograms will appear as if they're sunk into or floating above surfaces that they're sitting on.

- Holograms won't be stable. As you walk around, you'll notice that they move.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's particularly crucial for authors to make sure that their IPD is set correctly. Otherwise, all operators who use the guide will see misaligned holograms.

## Calibrate your HoloLens 2 device

1. When you turn on the device for the first time, the following system prompt automatically appears: "Let's adjust [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] for your eyes." To begin calibration, select **Adjust**.

    ![Adjust prompt.](media/adjust-prompt-HL2-calibration.png "Adjust prompt")

2. If the pop-up doesn't appear, use the start gesture to open the **Start** menu. For help with gestures, see [Gestures for navigating Dynamics 365 Guides](/mr-docs/guides/hl1).

3. If **Settings** isn't pinned to the **Start** menu, select the plus sign (**+**) button to view all apps.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To select something on the holographic **Start** menu, just touch it with your index finger.

4. Select **Settings**.

5. Select **System**.

6. In the side panel, select **Calibration**.

7. Select **Run Eye Calibration**.

8. Follow the on-screen instructions.
