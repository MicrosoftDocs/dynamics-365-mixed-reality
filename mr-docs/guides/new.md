[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] app version 103.1907.4001.0 brings a new look and feel to the PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps. We improved the user experience and aligned it with the Dynamics 365 family of apps. 
 
#### Improvements in this release

- The PC app is now fully responsive across various screen sizes. 

- The navigation menu on the left and bottom right of the PC app makes it much faster to navigate between guide content and guide anchor settings. 
 
- “Gaze-dwell” interactions on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] are consistently placed on the left side of list items to make it easier to select while browsing. 

- 3D models are loaded for each step to improve performance on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].
 
This **What's New** panel will continue to inform you of new and noteworthy features in each monthly release.

### June 3, 2019

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] app version 103.1905.31001 introduces an improved anchoring (alignment) experience for [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. The PC app doesn’t require you to choose an anchoring method before creating a guide so you can start creating content right away. You can also switch between anchoring methods after creating a guide. The PC app also provides better step-by-step guidance for choosing the appropriate method for anchoring mixed reality instructions to your workspace.

If you choose to create a guide using a digital anchor, you can now use a pre-set 3D model, so you don’t have to choose a 3D model 
before proceeding.

> [!NOTE]
> To take advantage of the new anchoring improvements, you must update the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)] solution in the Dynamics 365 
admin center. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade" target="_blank">Upgrade your Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution</a> or contact your Dynamics 365 administrator.
