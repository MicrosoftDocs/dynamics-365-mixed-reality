## What's new in Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview)

This page provides details about the latest releases of [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)] organized by release date.  

### August 6, 2019
Dynamics 365 Guides app version 104.1908.2001.0 fixes an issue in the July 23rd release of the HoloLens app that prevented the list of guides from being shown in the HoloLens application for Europe, Middle East, and Asia-based customers. We also released an updated version of the Power BI reporting template that fixes a bug related to missing data causing the report to break.

To get this upgrade, you only need to update the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app from the Microsoft store. You don't need to update the Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution. For the Power BI report, please visit https://<i></i>aka.ms/guidesreport.

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] app version 103.1907.4001.0 brings a new look and feel to the PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps. We improved the user experience and aligned it with the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] family of apps. 
 
#### Improvements in this release

- The PC app is now fully responsive across various screen sizes. 

- The navigation menu on the left and bottom right of the PC app makes it much faster to navigate between guide content and guide anchor settings. 
 
- “Gaze-dwell” interactions on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] are consistently placed on the left side of list items to make it easier to select while browsing. 

- 3D models are loaded for each step to improve performance on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].
 
This **What's New** panel will continue to inform you of new and noteworthy features in each monthly release.

### June 3, 2019

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] app version 103.1905.31001 introduces an improved anchoring (alignment) experience for [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. The PC app doesn’t require you to choose an anchoring method before creating a guide so you can start creating content right away. You can also switch between anchoring methods after creating a guide. The PC app also provides better step-by-step guidance for choosing the appropriate method for anchoring mixed reality instructions to your workspace.

If you choose to create a guide using a digital anchor, you can now use a pre-set 3D model, so you don’t have to choose a 3D model 
before proceeding.

> [!NOTE]
> To take advantage of the new anchoring improvements, you must update the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)] solution in the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] 
admin center. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade" target="_blank">Upgrade your Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution</a> or contact your [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] administrator.
