This page provides details about the latest releases of [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)] organized by release date.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The next release planned for October will require all customers to do a mandatory update of the Dynamics 365 Guides apps and solution. Please work with your IT admin to plan downtime for this update.

### August 27, 2019
[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] app version 104.1908.24001 and solution version 104.1908.0.117 includes the following updates:

- **Accessibility enhancements.** The PC application offers better color contrast and support for high-contrast mode for visually impaired users. Use the keyboard to tab through the user interface while using Narrator to read various authoring options. In preview mode, you can manipulate 3D models using the keyboard.

- **Improved hologram manipulation.** Holograms move more naturally as you place them in space, making it easier to accurately align holograms to the real world.

- **Support for additional languages**. The PC app and the HoloLens app now support the following languages: English (US, UK), French (France, Canada), German, Dutch (Netherlands), Spanish, Italian, Chinese (People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong SAR), Japanese, and Korean.

> [!NOTE]
> To get this update, you need to update the PC app and the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app from the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] store. Updating the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)] solution is not mandatory, but you need to update it if you intend to use the app in the newly supported languages. 

### August 6, 2019
[!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app version 104.1908.2001.0 fixes an issue in the July 23rd release of the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app that prevented the list of guides from being shown in the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] application for Europe, Middle East, and Asia-based customers. We also released an updated version of the Power BI reporting template that fixes a bug related to missing data causing the report to break.

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] app version 103.1907.4001.0 brings a new look and feel to the PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps.

#### Improvements in this release

- The PC app is now fully responsive across various screen sizes. 

- The navigation menu on the left and bottom right of the PC app makes it much faster to navigate between guide content and guide anchor settings. 
 
- “Gaze-dwell” interactions on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] are consistently placed on the left side of list items to make it easier to select while browsing. 

- 3D models are loaded for each step to improve performance on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].
 
This **What's New** panel will continue to inform you of new and noteworthy features in each monthly release.

### June 3, 2019

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] app version 103.1905.31001 introduces an improved anchoring (alignment) experience for [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. The PC app doesn’t require you to choose an anchoring method before creating a guide so you can start creating content right away. You can also switch between anchoring methods after creating a guide. The PC app also provides better step-by-step guidance for choosing the appropriate method for anchoring mixed reality instructions to your workspace.

If you choose to create a guide using a digital anchor, you can now use a pre-set 3D model, so you don’t have to choose a 3D model 
before proceeding.

> [!NOTE]
> To take advantage of the new anchoring improvements, you must update the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides-preview](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides-preview.md)] solution in the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] 
admin center. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade" target="_blank">Upgrade your Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution</a> or contact your [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] administrator.
