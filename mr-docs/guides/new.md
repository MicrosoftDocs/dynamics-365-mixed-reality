> [!IMPORTANT]
> Guides Dataverse solution version 900.x is compatible with Guides 800 solutions. If you update to the 900 solution, update the PC and HoloLens apps. Guides 901.x, scheduled to be released in December 2023, is a foundational change and won't be compatible with Guides 800 solutions. If you choose not to update the solution and remain on the version 800 solution and compatible versions of the PC and HoloLens apps, there's no impact.
>
> Work with your IT admin to schedule installation updates or <a href="/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade" target="_blank">see instructions for updating the solution</a>. You can also [learn more about which solutions work with which applications](admin-apps-solution-compatibility.md).
