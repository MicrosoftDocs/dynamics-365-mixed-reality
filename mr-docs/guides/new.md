- The navigation menu on the left and bottom right of the PC app makes it much faster to navigate between guide content and guide anchor settings. 
 
- “Gaze-dwell” interactions on HoloLens are consistently placed on the left side of list items to make it easier to select while browsing. 

- 3D models are loaded for each step to improve performance on HoloLens.

Guides app version 103.1905.31001 introduces an improved anchoring (alignment) experience for Dynamics 365 Guides in preview. The PC app doesn’t require you to choose an anchoring method before creating a guide so you can start creating content right away. You can also switch between anchoring methods after creating a guide. The PC app also provides better step-by-step guidance for choosing the appropriate method for anchoring mixed reality instructions to your workspace.

If you choose to create a guide using a digital anchor, you can now use a pre-set 3D model, so you don’t have to choose a 3D model 
before proceeding.

> [!NOTE]
> To take advantage of the new anchoring improvements, you must update the Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution in the Dynamics 365 
admin center. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade" target="_blank">Upgrade your Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution</a> or contact your Dynamics 365 administrator.
