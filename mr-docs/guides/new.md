Dynamics 365 Guides app version 1.3 introduces integration with Dynamics 365 for Field Service. Field Service customers can now attach guides to Field Service tasks in Dynamics 365. When work orders are assigned to technicians, the technicians can launch the assigned guide in a dedicated tab in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens application and do their work.

Note that to use this feature, you'll need:

- A Dynamics 365 instance (not just a Common Data Service instance) with Field Service version 8.6.0.183 or later.

- Dynamics 365 Guides Common Data Service 104.1907.0.18 or later. [Learn how to upgrade to the latest solution.](upgrade.md)

- Dynamics 365 Guides PC app and HoloLens app versions 104.1907.XXXX or later. [Learn how to install the apps.]().

### July 9, 2019

Dynamics 365 Guides **app version 103.1907.4001.0** brings a new look and feel to the PC and HoloLens apps. We improved the user experience and aligned it with the Dynamics 365 family of apps. 
 
#### Improvements in this release

- The PC app is now fully responsive across various screen sizes. 

- The navigation menu on the left and bottom right of the PC app makes it much faster to navigate between guide content and guide anchor settings. 
 
- “Gaze-dwell” interactions on HoloLens are consistently placed on the left side of list items to make it easier to select while browsing. 

- 3D models are loaded for each step to improve performance on HoloLens.
 
This **What's New** panel will continue to inform you of new and noteworthy features in each monthly release.

### June 3, 2019

Dynamics 365 Guides **app version 103.1905.31001** introduces an improved anchoring (alignment) experience for Dynamics 365 Guides in preview. The PC app doesn’t require you to choose an anchoring method before creating a guide so you can start creating content right away. You can also switch between anchoring methods after creating a guide. The PC app also provides better step-by-step guidance for choosing the appropriate method for anchoring mixed reality instructions to your workspace.

If you choose to create a guide using a digital anchor, you can now use a pre-set 3D model, so you don’t have to choose a 3D model 
before proceeding.

> [!NOTE]
> To take advantage of the new anchoring improvements, you must update the Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution in the Dynamics 365 
admin center. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade" target="_blank">Upgrade your Dynamics 365 Guides (Preview) solution</a> or contact your Dynamics 365 administrator.

For more information on authoring a guide with the PC application, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-authoring" target="_blank">Use the PC authoring application to create a guide</a>.
