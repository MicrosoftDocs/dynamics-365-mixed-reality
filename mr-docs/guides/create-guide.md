# Create a guide in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, you always create a guide in the PC app. If you want to organize your guides into folders, [create your folders](admin-create-folders.md) and then create your guides. After you create the guide, you can [structure it in the Outline page](structure-guide.md), and then [add steps and 3D content or 2D media](pc-app-step-editor-overview.md).

1. [Open the PC app](install-sign-in-pc-app.md).

2. Select **Create a guide**.

3. Go to the folder that you want to save the guide in. You can navigate the folder structure by going to the **All** tab or by using the breadcrumbs above the **Filter by name** box. Note that folders never appear on the **Recent** tab. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > To learn how to create a folder by using the Guides model-driven app, select **Learn about folders**. 

4. Enter a name for the guide, and then select **Create**. The guide will be saved in the current folder. 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you're planning to create multiple versions of the guide, you might want to add **\_v2**, **\_v3**, and so on, as part of the name. You can also use the **Save a Copy** command on the **File** menu if you're creating multiple versions of the same guide.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you create a guide by using the PC app, a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data file is automatically created in Microsoft Dataverse. This file is for internal use only. We don't recommend that you build functionality on top of this file, because it might change over time.

After you create your guide, the **Outline** page appears. To learn more about how to work with the **Outline** page, see [Structure your guide in the Outline page](structure-guide.md).

## How changes are synced between the PC app and the HoloLens app

The PC authoring app and the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app are connected through the cloud, where your [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] files and content are stored.

When you author a guide, all changes are saved on both the computer and the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)]. Therefore, it's easy to switch between devices. Autosave checks for changes every four seconds.

You must be online to use [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> When you switch from one device to the other, it's a good idea to close the guide, to make sure that you don't lose any work.
