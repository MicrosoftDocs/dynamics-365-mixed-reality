# Dynamics 365 Guides trial FAQ

## What are the system requirements for the trial?

You need a PC and a HoloLens device. [Learn more about device requirements](requirements.md)

## Can I sign up for multiple Dynamics 365 apps such as Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service?

Yes, you can. To view all available trials, [visit the trial hub page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/dynamics-365-free-trial/). You can use the same email account to sign up for different trials. However, it's not possible to have multiple apps on the same trial site. Each trial will be on a different org and URL. The trial data can't be shared across apps.

> [!NOTE]
> To sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Guides trial, you must have an Azure Active Directory account. You can't use a consumer email account. 

## What should I do if I haven't received trial details?

I didn't receive the trial details email after signing up, what should I do?

When you sign up for the trial, you'll receive an email with the trial details. If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder. 

## How do I add more users to a trial?

To add users, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) using the trial admin account. Follow the [admin center guidance](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to add users up to the trial license limit. If the user you are adding already has a Microsoft 365 account, assign them an appropriate security role in the trial org. For more information, see [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).

## How many users can I add to my trial environment?

You can add an unlimited number of users to the trial environment.

## How do I reset the trial environment?
You can't reset the trial environment. However, at the end of the 60-day trial, you can extend for an additional 30 days.

## Trial expiration and extension

Why did my trial expire before the end of the trial period?

The trial expires if there's no activity for 14 consecutive days. An email notification is sent to you after seven days of inactivity. Expired trials cannot be reactivated. However, you can start a new trial.

How do I extend the trial?
You can extend the trial for an additional 30 days in the admin center. For instructions, see [Extend your trial](/power-platform/admin/trial-environments#extend-a-trial-standard-environment). You can extend your trial once.

## Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

Yes, you can [purchase a subscription](setup-step-one.md) of Dynamics 365 Guides after the trial has ended. If you want to keep the content that you create during the trial, you can use the [Content Migration Tool](migrate.md). 

## What are the trial limits and quotas?

You can use the trial version of Dynamics 365 Guides for up to 60 days. 

## How do I start using the trial?

After you sign up for the trial, you'll see the [Get started](get-started.md) page. This page provides links for downloading the apps and links to user guides and tutorials. See also [What to try](trial-signup.md) on the trial sign-up page.

## What features are available in the trial?

All features are available during the trial. To use calling capabilities, you must have a Microsoft Teams license or a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license. 

## How long does the trial last?

The trial lasts 60 days. At the end of the trial, you have the option to extend for another 30 days. 

## Can I access the previous 30-day trial?

The 30-day trial is not recommended for new subscribers as it has a shorter trial period and is limited to one trial environment per tenant. The [30-day trial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2106016) is available, however, for customers who can't install the new trial due to corporate policies. 

## What if my trial signup fails?

You can sign up for a [30-day trial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2106016) (previous trial experience).
