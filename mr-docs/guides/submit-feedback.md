# Submit feedback on Dynamics 365 Guides through the Feedback Hub

If you run into an issue with Dynamics 365 Guides, you can report it through the Feedback Hub app (available for Windows devices). Use the Feedback Hub app to submit screenshots and provide extra telemetry to help Microsoft investigate a problem. Follow this process on the device you are having issues with (HoloLens or PC).

1. Start the Feedback Hub app. If you uninstalled it previously, download the app from the Windows Store.

1. Select **Report a problem**.

1. In the **Enter your feedback** section, summarize the problem, describe it in more detail, and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Choose a category** section, select **Apps** and **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides**. If the app isn't listed, start Dynamics 365 Guides on your device, and then select the **Refresh** button. Select **Next** when you're done.

1. When you're prompted to find similar feedback, take a quick look at the list to see if the same issue has already been reported. If not, select **New feedback**, and then select **Next**.

1. Under **Add more details**, select the options that you feel are applicable.

1. Attach any screenshots and/or 3D objects (if permitted by your company policies).

1. Select **Recreate my problem**, and then select **Start recording**. Open Dynamics 365 Guides again, and then repeat the actions that caused the problem. This will attach telemetry data to your feedback and make it easier for Microsoft to diagnose the problem. Your data is protected under the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). Return to the Feedback Hub app when you're finished. 

   > [!Note]
   > To provide the best possible data for fixing issues, we recommend that you set your device telemetry to **Optional Diagnostic data** when you set up Dynamics 365 Guides. You can also make this change through the **Settings** menu within the app:
   > - For Windows 10: Select **Start** > **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Diagnostics & feedback** > **Optional Diagnostic data**.
   > - For Windows 11: Right-click the **Start** button and select **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Diagnostics & feedback** > **Diagnostic data**.

1. After you finish the recording, you have the option to delete the logs and try again.

1. If you agree to sending the attached files, select the **I agree to send attached files and diagnostics to Microsoft along with my feedback** check box, and then select **Submit**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're using a Wi-Fi connection, don't shut down your device right away. Allow a few minutes for the attachments to be uploaded.
