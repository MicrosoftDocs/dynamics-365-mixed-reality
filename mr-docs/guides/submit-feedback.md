# Submit feedback on Dynamics 365 Guides through the Feedback Hub

If you run into an issue with Dynamics 365 Guides, you can report it through the Feedback Hub app (available for Windows devices). Use the Feedback Hub app to submit screenshots and provide extra telemetry to help Microsoft investigate a problem. Follow this process on the device you are having issues with (HoloLens or PC).

1. Start the Feedback Hub app. If you uninstalled it previously, download the app from the Windows Store.

2. Select **Report a problem**.

3. Under **Enter your feedback**, summarize the problem, describe it in more detail, and then select **Next**.

4. Under **Choose a category**, select **Apps** in the first list, and then select **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides** in the second list. If the app isn't listed, start Dynamics 365 Guides on your device, and then select the **Refresh** button. Select **Next** when you're done.

5. When you're prompted to find similar feedback, take a quick look at the list to see if the same issue has already been reported. If not, select **New 
feedback**, and then select **Next**.

8. Select **Recreate my problem**, and then select **Start recording**. Open back up Dynamics 365 Guides and repeat the actions you have taken to recreate the problem you are facing. This will attach telemetry data to your feedback and make it easier for Microsoft 
to diagnose the problem. Your data is protected under the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). 
Return to the Feedback Hub app when you're finished.
