# Install and sign in to the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

[!INCLUDE [azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](../includes/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

If you haven't already installed the Microsoft HoloLens app on your HoloLens device (or if it hasn't already been installed for you), you can install it from the Microsoft Store.

You must have a license to install the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app. You can also [sign up for a free trial of Dynamics 365 Guides](setup.md).
