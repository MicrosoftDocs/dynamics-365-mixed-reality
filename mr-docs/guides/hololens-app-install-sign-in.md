# Install and sign in to the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

If you haven't already installed the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device (or if it hasn't already been installed for you), you can install it from the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store.

You must have a license to install the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app. You can also [sign up for a free trial of Dynamics 365 Guides](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can [add a guest user in Dynamics 365 Guides](admin-add-guest-user.md) for users that have an Azure Active Directory account but aren't members of your organization. Guest users can only operate guides in the HoloLens app; they can't author guides in the PC or HoloLens apps.
