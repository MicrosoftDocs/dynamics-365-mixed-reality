# Activate, deactivate, or delete a guide or guide content (video, image, or 3D part) in Dynamics 365 Guides (for admins)

If [a guide has been deactivated](pc-app-deactivate-guide.md) in Guides, you can reactivate it. When you reactivate a guide, it immediately becomes available for authors to open or edit in the PC app. You can deactivate a guide or permanently delete it if you're sure that you no longer need it.

You can also activate, deactivate, or delete specific guide content (video, image, or 3D part).

  > [!TIP]
  > If you're an author and want to deactivate a guide, see [deactivate a guide or guide content (video, image, or 3D part)](pc-app-deactivate-guide.md).

## Activate, deactivate, or delete a guide

1. [Open the model-driven app](open-model-driven-app.md) in Guides.

1. In the drop-down list above the grid, select **Inactive Guides** to view all the guides that are currently inactive.
