# Assign an Author or Operator role to an individual user in Dynamics 365 Guides

If you're a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides admin, you can assign an Author or Operator role to users to limit what they can do in the apps. The Restricted Author and 
Restricted Operator roles provide an extra layer of control. [Learn about the privileges provided by each role](admin-role-types.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also assign user roles in bulk by using [Microsoft Entra groups](admin-assign-role-groups.md).

[!INCLUDE [azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](../includes/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

- The latest Dynamics 365 Guides solution must be installed. For more information, see [Update to the latest solution](upgrade.md).

- You must have access to the Microsoft Power Platform admin center and have full admin privileges.
