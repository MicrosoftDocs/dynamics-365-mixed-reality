Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize empowers sellers to showcase and customize products in a real-world
environment. This helps create a shared understanding between buyer and seller to accelerate complex sales processes. In industries 
like manufacturing, healthcare, and automotive, where products are often complex and highly configurable, or simply too cumbersome 
to carry around, <!--self, the need isn't key, it's acute. "Having a robust method of product visualization is key"?-->the need for product visualization is key. It builds a buyer's confidence early in the sales process, so costly 
change orders are reduced and customer satisfaction is higher.

Using Dynamics 365 Product Visualize, sellers can show products to customers 
directly within their Dynamics 365 Sales workflow. Spatial and configuration notes are all saved directly within the associated 
sales opportunity. Because sales tasks commonly require more than just one individual, sellers can leverage session content directly in 
Microsoft Teams to improve internal collaboration and deliver customer-oriented solutions that are critical to accelerating the 
sales process.
