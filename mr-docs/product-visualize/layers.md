# Show or hide layers in a 3D model in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A single 3D model in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize consists of one or more layers, which you can think of as categorized objects often grouped by function or location. 

You can create layers in model design software tools such as CAD. You can build layers in a nested or flattened format. 

## Using the Layers tool

In Dynamics 365 Product Visualize, you use the Layers tool to show or hide layers in a 3D model that has been placed in a scene.

When you select the **Layers** tool, you'll see a list of all the layers in the model.

A single layer can also act as a folder that includes other layers. You can expand or collapse the folder by selecting the [+] or [-] button.

By default, all layers in the model are visible. 

## Show or hide a layer

1. After placing a model, select **Layers** on the right side of the screen.
