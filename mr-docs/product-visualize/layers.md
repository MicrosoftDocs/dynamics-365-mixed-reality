# Show or hide layers in a 3D model in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A single 3D model in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize consists of one or more layers, which you can think of as categorized objects often grouped by function or location. A single layer can also act as a folder that includes other layers.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Folder containing folders](media/nested-folder.png "Folder containing folders")

You can create layers in a flattened or nested format by using CAD model design software tools. For more information about converting CAD models to use with Dynamics 365 Product Visualize, see [Convert your 3D (CAD) models](convert-models.md).

## Show or hide a layer

1. After placing a model, tap **Layers** at the bottom of the screen. 

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Select Layers](media/layers-tool.png "Select Layers")

2. Tap the check box for the layer you want to show or hide.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Tap check box](media/show-hide-layers.png "Tap the check box")


## Some tips for working with layers

- To expand or collapse a layer, tap the arrow button. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Expand or collapse a layer](media/expand-collapse.png "Expand or collapse a layer")

- To select all unselected layers, tap **Invert**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Invert selected layers](media/invert.png "Invert selected layers")

- To show or hide all layers, select the uppermost check box. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Show or hide all layers](media/show-hide-all.png "Show or hide all layers")
