# Enable product dimensions in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Dynamics 365 Product Visualize includes a tool to display your model measurements in imperial or metric units. To display model dimensions, you must enable the product dimensions feature. More information: [Enable product dimensions feature](enable-preview-features.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Product dimensions is a preview feature. Preview features are experimental features that provide access to the latest innovations that the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize team is working on.
