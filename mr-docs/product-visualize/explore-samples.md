# Explore sample 3D models in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Dynamics 365 Product Visualize comes with sample 3D models you can try out even if you don't have a Dynamics 365 subscription. Use the sample content to try the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize app and play with 3D models. When you explore a 3D model this way, you place it just like you would any other 3D model, and you can also add notes to the model. However, any notes you add to a sample model won't be saved when you close Dynamics 365 Product Visualize.

**To open a sample 3D model**

1. Open the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize app.

2. On the welcome screen, tap **Try it**.

     > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
     > ![Welcome screen](media/welcome.png "Welcome screen")

     You can also tap **Main** ![Main menu](media/hamburger-icon.png "Main menu"), and then tap **Sample products** to see samples.

     > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
     > ![Sample products menu item](media/sample-products-menu.png "Sample products menu item")
 
3. On the **My Active Mixed Reality Sessions** screen, select the **Contoso, Ltd. Mfg Sale**. 

     > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
     > ![Sample mixed-reality session](media/sample-opportunity.png "Sample mixed-reality session")

4. Tap a product you want to open.

     > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
     > ![Sample products](media/sample-products.png "Sample products")

5. Place the model as described in [Place and manipulate 3D models](manipulate-models.md), and then size, rotate, move, or lift the model.

6. Add notes as described in [Add a note to your 3D model](add-note.md). Notes added to sample models aren't saved when you close Dynamics 365 Product Visualize or replace the model.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to see dimensions for the model, enable the **Product dimensions** feature. To enable this feature, see [Enable product dimensions](product-dimensions.md). After enabling the feature, tap **Dimensions** at the bottom of the screen to see the dimensions for the 3D model.<br><br>Preview features are experimental features that provide access to new innovations that the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize team is working on.
